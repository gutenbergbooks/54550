<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This little book is intended as a general commentary
and explanation of the more important
phases of the ancient life and arts of the
Indians of Mexico and Central America, and especially
of their history. The substance of it is drawn
from many sources, for the anthropologist must
mould together and harmonize the gross results of
several sciences. Arch&aelig;ology, ethnology, somatology,
and linguistics all make their special contributions
and we are only on the threshold of our subject.
In the Mexican and Central American field we
find the accumulated writings that result from four
hundred years of European contact with the Indians
and in addition a mass of native documents and
monumental inscriptions expressed in several hieroglyphic
systems.</p>
<p>The general method of this book will be to take
up in order the recognized &ldquo;horizons&rdquo; of pre-Columbian
history, beginning with the earliest of
which we have knowledge. In relation to each horizon
we will examine the records and discuss the
principal developments in arts, beliefs, and social
structures. The introductory chapter is designed
to put before the reader such facts as may be necessary
for a ready understanding of the discussions
and explanations that will follow.</p>
<p>The Mexican Hall of the American Museum of
Natural History furnishes illustrations of most of
the facts given herewith. This Hall contains both
originals and casts brought together by various
expeditions of the Museum and of other scientific
institutions. The principal patrons of science
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
whose names should be mentioned in connection
with the upbuilding of these collections are: Willard
Brown, Austin Corbin, R. P. Doremus, Anson W.
Hard, Archer M. Huntington, Morris K. Jesup,
James H. Jones, Minor C. Keith, the Duke of
Loubat, William Mack, Henry Marquand, Doctor
William Pepper, A. D. Straus, I. McI. Strong, Cornelius
Vanderbilt, Henry Villard, William C. Whitney.
But thanks are also due to innumerable persons
who have contributed single specimens and
small collections as well as those who have placed
information at the disposal of the scientific staff.
The principal collectors have been: George Byron
Gordon, Ale&#353; Hrdli&#269;ka, Carl Lumholtz, Francis C.
Nicholas, Marshall H. Saville, Eduard Seler, Herbert
J. Spinden, and John L. Stephens.</p>

<h2 id="c2">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>Geography and Natural Environment.</h3>
<p>Unfortunately
the terms &ldquo;Mexico and Central America&rdquo;
are not mutually exclusive. Central America is a
natural division comprised between the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec and the Isthmus of Panama. Mexico
is a political division that
includes several states in
Central America, namely,
Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche,
Yucatan, and the territory
of Quintana Roo.
The ancient high cultures
of Mexico hardly extended
as far north as the Tropic
of Cancer and the region
beyond this is of slight interest
to us. Positions
south of Mexico will often
be referred to the areas of
the modern political units
although these have no immediate
relation to pre-Spanish conditions. These
political units are: Guatemala, British Honduras,
Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.</p>
<div class="img" id="img2">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 1. The Great Snowstorm
of 1447 shown in the
Pictographic Record of the
Aztecs called Codex Telleriano
Remensis.</p>
</div>
<p>Although lying within the tropics, the territory
extending from the Isthmus of Panama to Central
Mexico exhibits great extremes of climate and topography
and hence of plant and animal life. The
year is everywhere divided into a wet and a dry
season but the relative duration of each depends
upon land form and altitude. The coast of the
Pacific is considerably drier than that of the Atlantic.
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Three climatic zones are generally recognized,
namely, the <i>Tierra Caliente</i> (Hot Land),
<i>Tierra Templada</i> (Temperate Land), and <i>Tierra
Fria</i> (Cold Land), and in some regions each of
these has an arid and a humid strip. The change
from luxuriant forests to open thorny deserts is
often very sudden. On the high plateau or <i>Tierra
Fria</i> the natural warmth of the latitude is largely
overcome by the altitude. In the Valley of Mexico
snow falls only at rare intervals, yet chilling winds
are common in the winter. Much of the plateau
from Mexico south into Guatemala is open farming
land well suited to the raising of maize and wheat
where water is sufficient. The shoulders of the
mountains bear forests of pine and oak while the
highest peaks are crowned with perpetual snow.</p>
<p>A description of the mountains, rivers, and lakes
will help towards an understanding of the problems
that are before us. The broad plateau, crossed by
irregular ranges of mountains, that occupies the
states of New Mexico and Arizona continues far
south into Mexico. On the western rim the Sierra
Madre lifts a great pine-covered barrier, beyond
which the land drops off quickly into the hot fringe
of coastal plain bordering the Pacific Ocean and the
Gulf of California. The highest mountains of the
western Sierra Madre are El Nevado and Colima,
the first a snowy peak 14,370 feet high and the second
an active volcano 12,278 feet high. On the eastern
rim of the central plateau the second Sierra
Madre is less continuous but it culminates in the
loftiest peak of all Mexico&mdash;the wonderful cone of
Orizaba. This mountain rises from the tropical
jungles well into the region of perpetual snow and
attains an elevation of 18,314 feet above the sea.
Its name in Aztecan is Citlaltepetl, which means
Star Mountain. Two other famous peaks of Mexico
are Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, both names
being pure Aztecan. The first means Smoking
Mountain and the second White Woman. These
volcanic crests rise into the snowy zone from the
table-land which is itself about 8,000 feet above the
sea.</p>

</div>
<p>In southern Mexico the plateau area enclosed between
the principal sierras narrows perceptibly,
because the shore line of the
Pacific and the mountain range
that parallels it swing more
and more towards the east.
At the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
a low valley separates the highland
area of Mexico from that
of Central America. This second
table-land is not so wide as
the one we have just considered
and is more deeply dissected by
rivers. The mountains of Guatemala
rise to a considerable altitude,
the highest being Tacan&aacute;
with 13,976 feet elevation. Active
volcanoes are numerous
and earthquakes frequent and
often disastrous. The Volcan
de Agua and the Volcan de
Fuego (Volcano of Water and Volcano of Fire)
look down upon Ciudad Vieja and Antigua Guatemala,
the old Spanish capitals which each in turn
destroyed. The cordillera still presents its most
abrupt front to the Pacific and on the eastern side,
in Guatemala and Honduras, there are high forest-bearing
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
ridges between the river systems. The
Cockscomb Mountains in British Honduras are a
low outlying group. In southern Nicaragua the
main chain is broken by a low broad valley that
extends from ocean to ocean. In Costa Rica and
Panama a single range stretches midway along the
narrow strip of land, with peaks that rise above
11,000 feet.</p>
<p>The lowland strip on the Pacific side of our area
is a narrow fringe. Like the central plateau it is
for the most part arid, but irrigation makes it productive.
The lowlands of the Atlantic side are generally
wet and heavily forested. The greatest land
mass of uniformly low elevation is the Peninsula of
Yucatan. In eastern Honduras and Nicaragua
there are extensive river valleys of low elevation.</p>
<p>The river systems of Mexico and Central America
flow into the two bounding oceans or into lakes
which have no outlets. Several closed basins occur
on the Mexican table-land. The Rio Nazas and the
Rio Nieves flow into salt marshes in the northern
state of Coahuila. But the most important interior
basin is the Valley of Mexico. In this mountain
enclosed valley, whose general level is 7,500 feet
above the sea, there are five lakes which in order
from north to south are named Tzompanco, Xaltocan,
Texcoco, Xochimilco, and Chalco. The last two
contain fresh water, since they drain into Lake
Texcoco, but the rest are more or less brackish.
Lake Texcoco is by far the largest, although its area
has been greatly reduced by natural and artificial
causes since the coming of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>The largest river of Mexico is the Rio Lerma
which takes the name Rio de Santiago during its
deep and tortuous passage from Lake Chapala to
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
the Pacific. Farther to the south is the Rio de las
Balsas which likewise flows into the western ocean.
The name means &ldquo;River of the Rafts&rdquo; and is given
because of a peculiar floating apparatus made of
gourds tied to a wooden framework that is used on
this stream. Flowing into the Gulf of Mexico are
several large streams, among which may be mentioned
the Panuco, Papaloapan, Grijalva, and Usumacinta.
The last is by far the greatest in volume
of water, and with its maze of tributaries drains a
large area of swamp and jungle in which are buried
some of the most wonderful ruined cities of the New
World.</p>
<p>In the northern part of Yucatan there are no rivers
on the surface on account of the porous limestone.
Instead there are great natural wells called
<i>cenotes</i> where the roofs of subterranean rivers have
fallen in. Many of the ancient cities were built near
such natural wells.</p>
<p>Passing to the south the most important river of
Guatemala is the Motagua, which has cut a fine valley
through a region of lofty mountains. In Honduras
there are several large rivers, including the
Uloa, Patuca, and Segovia. The lake region of
Nicaragua is drained by the San Juan River that
flows into the Caribbean Sea. Nearly all the
streams of Central America that flow into the Pacific
are short and steep torrents. An important
exception is the Lempa River that forms part of
the interior boundary of Salvador.</p>
<p>Concerning lakes, mention has already been made
of Chapala and Texcoco, the most important in
Mexico. The former is about fifty miles in length.
In the state of Michoacan there are a number of
beautiful lakes intimately connected with the history
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
and mythology of the Tarascan Indians. The most
famous is called Patzcuaro. In southern Yucatan
the shallow body of water known as Lake Peten
also has a distinct historical interest. Several lakes
in Guatemala are well known on account of the rare
beauty of their situation. Lake Atitlan is surrounded
by lofty mountains, and Lake Izabal, or
Golfo Dulce, is famous for the luxuriance of the
vegetation that screens its banks. Lakes Nicaragua
and Managua are well known on account of their
connection with the much-discussed canal projects.
The Island of Ometepe in Lake Nicaragua bears an
active volcano.</p>
<p>In regard to the geology it is only necessary to
point out a few of the more important characters.
The highlands which bear so many active and quiescent
volcanoes naturally show great masses of
eruptive rocks, some due to recent action and others
much more ancient. Porous tufa is a common material
for sculptures in many parts of Mexico and
Central America. In other places there are great
beds of softer and finer grained material also of
volcanic origin. In these places, such as Copan in
western Honduras and Mitla in southern Mexico,
building in stone received its greatest development.
The soft greenish stone of Copan seems to be a
solidified mud flow permeated with volcanic ash
rather than a true lava flow of melted rock. Limestones
are also common and important in the economic
development. In some regions there are beds
of a hard, blue limestone going back to the Carboniferous
epoch. This stone makes an excellent cement
after burning. The Peninsula of Yucatan is
a great plain of limestone of much more recent
formation. Like our own Florida it was once a
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
coral reef which was lifted above the sea by some
natural agency. This limestone gets older and
more solid as we approach the base of the peninsula
but at best is rather porous and coarse-grained.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 3. Yucatan Deer

</div>
<p>The fauna and flora present great variation. In
the moist lowlands the monkeys play in the tree tops
and the jaguar lies in wait for
its prey. Alligators and crocodiles
infest the rivers and
swamps. Two small species
of deer and the ocellated turkey
are important items in the
meat supply of Yucatan, that
includes also the iguana, the
peccary, and various large rodents.
The tapir and manatee
are the largest animals of the lowlands but
neither seems to have been of great significance to
the natives. Bats are frequently
represented in the ancient art
and a bat demon appears in several
myths.</p>

<p>Upon the highlands of Mexico
the Toltecan deer is still hunted,
together with the wild turkey
that is the parent of our domestic
birds. The turkey was, in fact,
domesticated by the Mexican
tribes. It probably occurred
southward over the Guatemalan
highlands, but is now extinct in
this latter region. In the southern
part of Central America the
place of the turkey as an item of diet is taken by
the curassow, a yellow-crested bird with black plumage.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
The coppery-tailed trogon, the famous quetzal,
was sacred in ancient times and is now the
emblem of Guatemala. This beautiful bird occurs
only in the cloud cap forest zone on the high mountains
of southern Mexico and Guatemala. Blue
macaws, parrots, paroquets, and humming birds
contributed their gay plumage to adorn headdresses
and feather-covered cloaks. These and many other
birds doubtless flitted about in the aviary of Moctezuma.
The black vulture, the king vulture, and the
harpy eagle are other conspicuous birds often figured
in the ancient art. The coyote, ocelot, and
puma are the principal beasts of prey on the
highlands.</p>
<p>Among the characteristic trees of the lowlands
may be mentioned the palm, which occurs in great
variety, the amate and ceiba, both of which attain to
large size, as well as mahogany, Spanish cedar
(which is not a cedar at all but a close relative of
the mahogany), campeche, or logwood, rosewood,
sapodilla, and other trees of commerce. Upon the
higher mountain slopes are forests of long-leaf pine
and of oak. In the desert stretches the cactus is
often tree-like and there are many shrubs that in
the brief spring become masses of highly-colored
blossoms.</p>
<p>Some of the principal crops of Mexico and Central
America have been introduced from the Old World,
including coffee, sugar cane, and bananas. Other
crops such as maize, beans, chili peppers, cocoa, etc.,
are indigenous. Among the native fruits may be
mentioned the aguacate, or alligator pear, the mamey,
the anona, or custard apple, the guanabina,
jocote, and nance.</p>

<h3>History of European Contact.</h3>
<p>The great area
with which we are concerned has been in touch with
Europe since the beginning of the sixteenth century.
Columbus, on his last voyage in 1502, landed on the
northern coast of Honduras and rounded the stormy
cape called Gracias &agrave; Dios. Later he skirted the
shore of Costa Rica and Panama and entered the
body of water which was named in his honor Bahia
del Almirante&mdash;Bay of the Admiral. He brought
back sensational news of the gold in possession of
the natives, which they had told him came from a
district called Veragua. After a few years of
stormy warfare the Spaniards established themselves
firmly in this golden land. Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez de
Balboa, who emerged from the bickering mob as
the strongest leader, was the first white man to
cross the Isthmus. This he did in 1513, grandiloquently
laying claim to the Pacific
Ocean and all the shores that it
touched in the name of Spain.
The crown appointed the greedy
and black-hearted Pedrarias Davila
governor of Darien and in
1517 he succeeded in having Balboa
beheaded on a flimsy charge.
Colonization and exploration went
forward rapidly. In 1519 the old
city of Panama, now in ruins, was
founded. The rich region around the Nicaraguan
lakes was discovered by Gil Gonzalez Davila and
the city of Granada was founded in 1524. The exploration
from the southern base came in contact
with that from the north in Salvador shortly after
this event.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Let us now direct our attention to the conquest of
Mexico. Perhaps the Portuguese were the first to
sight the mainland of Yucatan in 1493. There is
little to prove this except one or two charts or maps
made in the first decade of the sixteenth century
that show the peninsula in its proper location. In
1511 or 1512 a ship from Darien was wrecked and
some of the sailors were cast upon the coast of
Yucatan. Most of them were killed and sacrificed,
but two survived. One of these survivors was
Geronimo de Aguilar, who later was rescued by
Cortez and became his guide and interpreter.</p>
<p>The first accredited voyage of discovery to Mexico
was one under the command of Francisco Hernandez
de Cordoba, which sailed from Cuba in
February, 1517. He coasted the northern and eastern
shores of Yucatan. When he attempted to obtain
water he was worsted in a serious battle with
the Maya Indians. His expedition finally returned
to Cuba in a sad plight. The next year Juan de
Grijalva set out to continue the exploration of the
new land with the stone-built cities. He landed at
Cozumel Island and took possession. He explored
the eastern coast of Yucatan as well as the northern
and western ones, discovered the mouth of the large
river that bears his name, and proceeded as far as
the Island of Sacrifices in the harbor of Vera Cruz.</p>
<p>The next year Hernando Cortez was sent out by
Velasquez, the governor of Cuba, to conquer the new
land. He landed at Cozumel Island and rescued
Geronimo de Aguilar. Then he followed the coast
to the mouth of the Grijalva River where he disembarked
and fought the important battle of Cintla,
the first engagement in the New World in which
cavalry was used. After a signal victory Cortez
continued his way to Vera Cruz. Here delay and
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
dissension seemed about to break the luck of the
invaders.</p>
<p>Although the Mexicans were somewhat inclined
to regard the Spaniards as supernatural visitants
and to associate their coming with the fabled return
of Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent, still Moctezuma
refused to grant
an interview to Cortez.
The Totonacan city of
Cempoalan opened its
gates and became allies
of the invaders. Finally,
at the instigation of
their stout-hearted captain,
the Spaniards destroyed
their ships on
the shore in order to
steel their resolution
through the impossibility
of retreat. Then the little band of 450 white
men with their retinue of natives marched towards
the highlands. The route led past Jalapa and over
the mountains to the fortified city of Tlaxcala. This
city, after a skirmish, likewise enlisted in the Spanish
cause, a course that came easy because Tlaxcala
was a traditional enemy of Tenochtitlan, the ancient
Mexico City, and had withstood the attacks of the
Aztecs for many years. From here Cortez passed
to the sacred city of Cholula where, suspecting
treachery, he caused many of the inhabitants to be
massacred.</p>

</div>
<p>In the Spanish histories one hears much concerning
the omens, the prophecies, and the vain
appeals to the gods that became more and more
frequent and frantic as the invaders approached
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
the capital. Arriving at Ixtapalapan they entered
upon the great causeway leading out to the Venice-like
city in the lake. Accepting the inevitable,
Moctezuma and his nobles met the Spaniards and
conducted them to the Palace of Axayacatl, which
was prepared for their habitation. This took place
in November, 1519. The fears of Moctezuma were
soon fulfilled, for he was taken prisoner and held as
a hostage of safety in his own capital.</p>

</div>
<p>Meanwhile Velasquez, convinced of the unfaithfulness
of Cortez, dispatched Narvaez to capture the
rebellious agent. But Narvaez was himself captured
and his soldiers went to augment the army
of the victor.</p>
<p>Alvarado had been left in command of the garrison
at Tenochtitlan during the absence of Cortez.
The time approached for the great feast of Tezcatlipoca
and the Spaniards, fearing the results of
this appeal to the principal Aztecan god, resolved
to be the first to strike. The multitude assembled
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
in the temple enclosure was massacred and after
this deed the soldiers fought their way back to the
stronghold in which they were quartered. The
Aztecs were thoroughly aroused by this unwarranted
cruelty as well as by the cupidity of the
Spaniards. Cortez hastened back to take personal
charge; but in spite of victories in the storming of
the pyramids and in other hand-to-hand contests,
the invaders were so weakened that their condition
was truly alarming. Moctezuma died in captivity
and the last restraint of the natives was removed.</p>
<p>The night of June 30, 1520, is famous as La Noche
Triste&mdash;The Sad Night&mdash;for on this night the Spaniards
attempted to steal out of the city that had
become untenable. The natives were warned by a
woman&rsquo;s shriek and a desperate encounter took
place on the narrow causeway loading to Tlacopan.
The bridges were torn down and the Spanish soldiers
in armor were hemmed in between the deep
canals. At last, however, the firm land was reached.
Here, instead of following up the victory, the natives
permitted the Spaniards to re-form their ranks. A
few days later Cortez was able to restore something
of his lost prestige by the decisive victory at
Otumba, after which he continued his retreat to
the friendly Tlaxcala.</p>
<p>A year was spent in recuperation, in building
boats for an attack from the lake, and in putting
down the Aztecan outposts. In the meantime the
natives were suffering from a dreadful visitation of
smallpox, introduced by the Spaniards, and Cuitlahuac,
the successor of Moctezuma, had died of this
disease after a rule of eighty days. Finally Tenochtitlan
was besieged again. The buildings were
leveled to the ground as the Spaniards advanced.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The brave defense of Cuauhtemoc availed for
naught against cannon and steel armor. On the
13th of August, 1521, the conquest of Tenochtitlan
was achieved and the spirit of a warlike people forever
broken.</p>
<p>The Valley of Mexico having been taken, numerous
expeditions were sent out to subdue the more
distant provinces and to establish colonies. Alvarado
invaded the south and by 1524 he had captured
Utatlan and other native strongholds on the highlands
of Guatemala and had invaded Salvador.
Cortez himself undertook a wonderful march from
Vera Cruz to the Gulf of Honduras to punish an
unruly subordinate. His course lay through the
swamps and jungles of the Usumacinta Basin,
thence across the savannahs of southern Yucatan
to Lake Peten, and, finally, over the mountains to
Lake Izabal and the Motagua River. Even today
much of his route would be called impassable for
an army. Puerto Cortez, on the northern coast of
Honduras, was founded at the conclusion of this
expedition. The exploitation of Yucatan and Tabasco
was granted to Francisco Montejo, who began
the conquest of this low-lying territory in 1527.
The first campaigns were disastrous and heartbreaking.
Several short-lived Salamancas were
founded, one of them at Chichen Itza. But the odds
were too great and by 1535 all the Spaniards had
been killed or expelled. The son of Montejo renewed
the struggle. In 1540 Campeche was founded
and early in 1542 the city of M&eacute;rida was established
upon the site of an earlier Mayan town.</p>
<p>Progress was also rapid in the north. Nu&ntilde;o de
Guzman departed in 1529 on a mission to conquer
Michoacan and the great northern province known
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
as New Galicia. His rule was marred by many acts
of cruelty. In 1538 Coronado, the successor of
Guzman, led his army northward to the land of the
Pueblo Indians and then out into the Great Plains.
Before the first English settlement was made in
North America the power of Spain was firmly established,
not only throughout Central America and
Mexico, but also in the southwestern part of the
United States.</p>
<p>The spiritual conquest was no less remarkable
than the territorial. The priests accompanied and
even preceded the armies with the doctrine of the
cross. The rough and ready characters that enliven
the wonderful drama of this period had the
vices of greed and cruelty, but nearly all were
imbued with a pride of religion, if not with the true
flame. The firmness and bigotry on the one hand
and the open sympathy on the other with which the
Catholic fathers met the practical problems before
them resulted in vast achievements. Either by accident
or design certain patron saints and efficacious
shrines of special interest to the natives were not
long in becoming known. The Virgin of Guadeloupe
and the Black Christ of Esquipulas brought many
converts to the foreign faith. Church building was
carried on apace. The various religious orders became
rich and powerful and exerted a strong influence
upon civil administration.</p>
<p>The later history of this great region can be
passed over briefly. Cortez was the first governor
general of Mexico but he was soon shorn of his
power as dictator at large. The First Audiencia
was appointed in 1528 and is noteworthy simply by
reason of its misrule. The Second Audiencia, beginning
two years later, put through some excellent
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
reform laws. The first Viceroy, the great and good
Mendoza, arrived in 1535 and for fifteen years the
land prospered under his rule, which was benign
without being weak. He was succeeded by Luis de
Velasco, who emancipated many of the enslaved
Indians. The long line of viceroys continued until
1821, when Spain was forced to relinquish her
provinces in America. Among the greatest of the
viceroys was Bucareli, the forty-sixth in line, who
ruled Mexico from 1771-1779 while the United
States of America were just beginning to feel the
pulse of life.</p>
<p>During the viceregal period in Mexico the region
to the south was ruled by the captain general of
Guatemala. The dominion was subdivided into five
departments corresponding to the modern republics
of Guatemala (which then included the Mexican
state of Chiapas), Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua,
and Costa Rica. Panama was ruled from the South
American province of New Granada.</p>
<p>Weakened by Napoleonic wars and rent by internal
dissensions, Spain found herself in the first
two decades of the nineteenth century unable to
maintain her waning power in America. Bolivar
and his brother patriots raised the standard of revolt
in South America in 1810 and in the same year
war for independence broke out in the north. Hidalgo,
the parish priest of Dolores, rang the liberty
bell of Mexican freedom on the 16th of September,
1810. This beloved patriot was captured the year
following, and shot, but the revolution, once begun,
was continued under Morelos and other leaders.
After 1815 the cause seemed hopeless, but in 1820
there was a new uprising and General Iturbide, who
was sent to put it down, turned his army against the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
government and established himself as emperor.
Central America was also included in this Mexican
empire. The rule of Iturbide soon became unpopular
and in 1823 he abdicated his throne. The Mexican
republic that was then instituted continued until
the French intervention in 1861. During this time
the most noteworthy events were the war with the
United States in 1846-47 and the passing of the
reform laws under Benito Juarez that freed Mexico
from the oppressions of the church.</p>
<p>As a result of the French intervention Maximilian
of Austria was made emperor. This unfortunate
ruler, who did much to beautify Mexico City, was
dethroned and shot in 1867. The republic was then
re-established.</p>
<p>The other republics of Central America formed a
federal union at the time the first Mexican empire
came to an end in 1823. This union was preserved
till 1839 and several later attempts were made to
restore it. The five republics have had such tempestuous
careers as a result of warfare, usurpation,
and political brigandage that their material and social
development has been stunted. Several are
now, however, on the high road to stability.</p>
<p>Panama was until 1903 a part of Colombia. British
Honduras had its origin in the concessions given
to English logwood gatherers and to the fact that
pirates found refuge behind the coral reefs that line
the shores. The English claim to the Mosquito
Coast rested upon a similar flimsy basis, and was
finally abandoned.</p>
<h3>Languages.</h3>
<p>The twenty distinct stocks of related
languages formerly recognized in Mexico and Central
America have now been greatly reduced. Of
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
those that remain, some occupied small areas and
had little in the way of dialectic variation, while
others stretched over wide territories and were divided
into many mutually unintelligible tongues,
which, in turn, were subdivided into well-defined
dialects. Several stocks are now approaching extinction
through the substitution of Spanish. A
number of languages, however, are still spoken by
hundreds of thousands of natives.</p>
<p>The language having the greatest geographical
extension within the area under consideration is the
Mexican, or Nahuan, now consolidated with the
Piman, Shoshonean, etc., in a great stock called the
Uto-Aztecan. In its extent this stock may be compared
to the Indo-Iranian of the Old World which
comprises most of the modern and ancient languages
of Europe as well as those of a large part of Asia.
Within the United States are the numerous Shoshonean
tribes found as far north as Idaho, reaching
into California on the one hand and into Texas on
the other. In southern Arizona and northwestern
Mexico come the Piman group. East of the Sierra
Madre are the Tarahumare and the Tepehuane.
These languages are mutually unintelligible, although
morphologically related, and all are subdivided
into dialects. The relationship is proved
through laborious comparison and analysis of the
words and grammar, in the same way as the philologist
proves that Persian, Greek, Russian, English
and Welsh are all cognate tongues. Farther to the
south are still other divisions of the stock; including
the Huichol and Cora of the mountainous region
north of Guadalajara and the Mexican or Aztecan
of the Valley of Mexico and adjacent country. The
Mexican language is still spoken by a million or
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
more natives and is divided into a number of dialects.
Properly the Aztecs are a single tribe whose
chief city was Tenochtitlan, the ancient Mexican
City. They first appear on the page of history as
the Mexitin, along with the closely related Chalca,
Xochimilca, etc. The people of Central Mexico
called their language Nahuatl, meaning &ldquo;clear
speech&rdquo; and nicknamed their relatives to the south,
Pipil, or &ldquo;boys&rdquo; because they spoke awkwardly.
Mexican colonies were widespread before the coming
of the Spaniards and during the Conquest the
distribution of this nation was made still greater.
The Mexicans, and especially the natives of Tlaxcala,
accompanied the Spaniards on military expeditions
against other tribes and as a consequence
many place names in southern Mexico and Guatemala
were translated into their language. There
were, however, large groups of Indians of Mexican
stock already located in southern Guatemala and
in Salvador. Still farther south were the Niquirao
of Nicaragua and a little-known group called the
Sigua in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The wide geographical distribution of Uto-Aztecan
languages has an undeniable historical
significance. The numerous tribes represent a
very wide range in culture albeit nearly all are
dwellers of arid or semi-arid regions. Some like
the Paiute, are miserable &ldquo;diggers&rdquo; willing to eat
anything that will support life; others like the
Comanche are warlike raiders; more progressive
tribes like the Hopi have adopted agriculture and
developed interesting arts and customs; while the
highest members of the group are among the most
civilized nations of the New World. It seems clear
that language can be used as a basis of classification
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
over a much greater stretch of time than can other
social habits summed up as &ldquo;culture.&rdquo; Particular
phases of art, religion, and government develop and
disappear, but the grouping of sounds used to express
ideas remains as proof that peoples now far
apart geographically, as well as in their habits and
achievements, were once close together. The peculiar
distribution of the Uto-Aztecan languages
may indicate a general southward movement of the
stock.</p>
<p>The second most important linguistic stock is the
Mayan, now spoken by over half a million people.
This stock has only one outlying member, namely,
the Huasteca of northern Vera Cruz. The other
twenty-one languages cover a continuous area in the
Mexican states of Yucatan, Tabasco, and Chiapas,
and in the republic of Guatemala. The most important
language of the group is the Maya proper,
which is spoken by the natives of Yucatan and by
the Lacandone Indians of the Usumacinta Valley.
The Tzental, Quich&eacute;, Cakchiquel, Chol, and Chorti
are other prominent languages.</p>
<p>In the region of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec are
the Zapotecan and Mixtecan stocks, which differ
widely in sound and structure from the Mayan and
Nahuan tongues that hem them in. West and east
of the Valley of Mexico are, respectively, the Tarascan
and Totonacan stocks, which show no great
amount of subdivision. In Honduras, Nicaragua,
and Costa Rica are several language groups that
have never been carefully studied. It seems likely
that some of these will be consolidated when words
and grammatical structures are better known. The
Chiapanecan languages were spoken in three localities
on the Pacific side of Nicaragua and Costa Rica,
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
while a fourth division occupied a small area far to
the northwest on the banks of the Chiapas River.
It is now believed that the Otomi group, as well as
a number of minor languages, including the Mazatecan,
belong in a single stock with the Chiapanecan.
If this supposed connection should prove true a
northern movement of the stock would be pretty
surely indicated. Several members of the Subtiaban
stock show the same south to north movement
and here there is evidence that the migration took
place some three centuries before the coming of
the Spaniards. Parts of the Isthmian region were
held by tribes having linguistic affiliation with South
America and it is not unlikely that a considerable
back flow from South America made itself felt along
the Atlantic coast of Central America, if we may
judge by ethnological features and by suggested
linguistic connections.</p>
<p>The great Hokan stock has now been extended
from California across northern Mexico to Texas,
taking in the Seri and numerous other tribes of low
culture. For the most part these tribes are extinct
or at least have lost the ancient speech.</p>
<h3>Ethnology.</h3>
<p>To a less extent than the native languages
the old-time customs still hold out against
the tide of European influence. In regions not
easily accessible on account of deserts, mountains,
or tropical jungles, there are a number of Indian
tribes that preserve in a large measure their ancient
arts and ideas. But the study of these remnant
peoples has not been very thorough.</p>

</div>
<p>The Pima, Seri, Tarahumare, Tepehuane, and
other tribes of the extreme north and northwest of
Mexico have until recent times been comparatively
unmodified by Spanish influences. Basketry, textiles,
and pottery have been maintained by them as
well as many religious ceremonies. Farther south
among the Cora and Huichol there also are surviving
arts. The woven fabrics of these Indians are
very beautiful but introduced ideas are frequently
seen. For instance, a very common motive in Huichol
textile art is the two-headed Austrian eagle
evidently taken from the coins of Charles V.
Crowns similar to those worn by the two-headed
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
eagle are often shown on the heads of rampant
animals. But most of the motives are doubtless of
native origin.</p>
<p>Among the Huichol and Tarahumare the curious
<i>peyote</i>, or <i>hikule</i> worship may be studied. A small
variety of cactus is eaten, which induces ecstasy or
stupor accompanied by color visions and peculiar
dreams. Elaborate ceremonies are associated with
the eating and gathering of this plant. The religious
cult of the peyote has swept over a large portion
of the Great Plains Area of the United States
and is known even to Indians in the neighborhood
of the Great Lakes. There can be no doubt that
the narcotic action of the peyote was known to the
Aztecs, who made a ceremonial use of it under the
name <i>teonanacatl</i>. An intoxicating drink called
<i>teswin</i> is commonly made in northern Mexico from
the heart of the mescal plant. It takes the place
of the famous <i>pulque</i>, the ancient beverage of the
Mexican highlands. Hunting dances in which are
employed regalia and ceremonial objects of great
interest occur among the Huichol and neighboring
tribes. The so-called &ldquo;god&rsquo;s eyes&rdquo; made of yarn
strung spider-web fashion over crossed sticks are
practically identical with the &ldquo;squash blossoms&rdquo; of
the Pueblo Indians. There are also real temple
structures, or &ldquo;god houses,&rdquo; which are very significant
when we consider the former importance of the
temple among the more highly civilized peoples to
the south. In these and other respects the Huichol
culture is about midway between the culture of the
Southwestern Pueblo tribes and that which formerly
existed in central Mexico.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in northern and central Mexico it is
possible to find many suggestions of ancient Indian
ways of living. In nearly all the outlying villages
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
the old-time thatched huts are still used, while
baskets, gourd vessels, wooden bowls, earthen pots,
and other household objects hark back to native origins,
although often modified by European contact.
For instance, glazing is commonly seen on the modern
pottery. Many travelers in Mexico bring away
as souvenirs pieces of pottery from Guadalajara
and Cuernavaca. These wares are made by Indians,
but in decoration they have only slight traces
of the ancient art of the Mexicans.</p>
<p>In dress there are noteworthy survivals. The
<i>serape</i> made either on the narrow hand loom or on
a crude form of the Spanish tread loom is a picturesque
element in the national dress that is
rapidly disappearing from view. Time was when
the rich plantation owner wore a gayly colored
blanket on <i>fiesta</i> days. The most famous centers
for the manufacture and sale of blankets were the
cities of Saltillo and San Miguel. The Saltillo pattern
shows a medallion consisting of concentric diamonds
in various colors upon an all-over design in
stripes. The motives are minute geometric figures
skilfully interlocked. The colors are rich and permanent
and are combined in a very pleasing manner.
Saltillo blankets must be classed among the finest
textile products of the world. The best period was
before 1850. San Miguel blankets show characteristically
a rosette instead of a diamond in the center.
Many beautiful blankets come from other localities
in Mexico. The Chimayo blankets have the same
part Indian, part Spanish origin and are made by
the Spanish-speaking natives in the mountain valleys
of New Mexico.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>In southern Mexico there are many towns of
Indians where the women still wear the finely embroidered
huipili. This old-time garment varies
considerably in different towns but as a rule it is
a simple sack-like gown cut square at the neck and
with short sleeves. Sometimes it is shortened to a
blouse, and is worn with a skirt; at other times a
short huipili is worn over a longer one. An easily
visited town where the natives still wear the old-time
dress is Amatlan, within an hour&rsquo;s walk of
Cordova. The women of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
have a gorgeous costume of which the most
remarkable feature is a wide ruff worn around the
neck or on the back of the head. The Mayan women
of Yucatan wear white huipili with needlework in
color around the bottom. On the highlands of
Guatemala the huipili is usually a blouse. The
skirt sometimes consists of a strip of cloth wrapped
several times around the body.</p>
<p>An interesting ceremony which survives in some
parts of Mexico and Guatemala has as its principal
feature a lofty pole with a swivel arrangement at
the top to which long ropes are attached. These
ropes are wound round the swivel and performers,
who may be dressed like birds, attach themselves
to the rope ends. During the process of unwinding
the performers whirl dizzily around the pole descending
lower and lower and swing in a wider and
wider circle till they reach the ground.</p>
<p>The Lacandone Indians live in the marshy jungles
that border the winding Usumacinta. They speak
the same tongue as the Maya Indians of Yucatan but
in the matter of culture they have acquired little
from the Spaniards. They still weave simple garments
and make pottery vessels. In hunting they
use the bow and arrow, the latter usually tipped
with a point of stone. In their religious practices
they use incense burners which are comparable to
those of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The Caribs occupy the greater part of the north
coast of Guatemala and Honduras, running east
from the port of Livingston on the Gulf of Amatique.
These people, originally of South America and later
of the West Indies as well, were deported by the
English from the Island of St. Vincent in 1796.
They have now established themselves in the new
land where they raise the manioc or cassava root
and press out the poisonous juice in a basketry tube
as do their kindred in the Orinoco Valley. Long
before the forcible immigration it is likely that the
Caribs, who were cannibalistic in habit, had raided
the shores of Central America in their seagoing
canoes. A significant passage in the chronicles of
the Mayas states that naked man-eating savages
visited Yucatan long before the coming of the
Spaniards.</p>
<p>The Mosquito Indians of the east coast of Nicaragua
and Honduras have a very considerable negro
admixture. They are fishermen of low culture.
Farther inland are found the Sumo who flatten the
heads of their children and who hold strange feasts
in honor of the dead in which the dancers are
masked so that none may be recognized. A string
is stretched over the tree tops from the grave to the
feasting place and over this string the ghost of the
dead person is supposed to walk. When everyone
has fallen in a drunken stupor from <i>mishla</i> the ghost
of the dead man departs for the land of the dead.
These Sumo Indians build large houses with open
sides and are very skilful at fishing with bow and
arrow and steering their canoes through white rapids.
They practise polygamous marriages, weave
cotton, and make interesting beadwork ornaments.</p>
<p>In the narrow Isthmian region there are tribes of
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
Indians that resist manfully the inroads of civilization.
Perhaps the best known of these are the San
Blas Indians who inhabit the mountain fastnesses
east of the Canal Zone. In northern Costa Rica the
Guatuso and Talamanca tribes still maintain to a
considerable degree their old native character.</p>
<h3>Physical Types.</h3>
<p>Minor physical differences in
stature, head form, and facial expression mark off
pretty clearly the tribes of this area from each other.
The stature is lowest among the Mayas and Mazatecs,
the average being about 5 feet 1 inch, while
among the Tarascans, Tlaxcalas, and Zapotecs, it
averages about 5 feet 3 inches. The other tribes of
Central America and of central Mexico fall between
these extremes. In northern Mexico the stature
increases considerably, average measurements for
the Yaqui being in excess of 5 feet 6 inches. To
make up for their lack of height the southern Indians
are sturdy and heavy muscled, with deep
chests. Their hair is usually black and straight,
but occasionally wavy. Light beards and mustaches
are sometimes worn, especially by the Mayas. The
eyes are so dark brown as to appear black to the
casual observer. They are set rather wide apart
and while usually horizontal they seem, in some instances,
to have a slight Mongoloid tilt. Noses vary
greatly but are often finely aquiline. The cephalic
index (obtained by dividing the breadth of the head
by its length and multiplying the result by 100) is
rather high. The Mayas are strongly round-headed
with an index of 85.0 while their linguistic relatives,
the Tzendals, have a medium index of 76.8. The
other tribes of southern Mexico fall between these
extremes. No long-headed peoples are found in
this area although in northern Mexico some tribes
approach the long-headed type.</p>

<h2 id="c3">Chapter I
<br />THE ARCHAIC HORIZON</h2>
<p>In 1910 an actual stratification of human products
was found in the environs of Mexico City in
which three principal culture horizons could be
readily discerned. A collection made at the time,
illustrating the objects characteristic of the three
strata, is on exhibition in the American Museum of
Natural History. In parts this stratification verified
theories of culture succession already held by
students working in this field. Since that time careful
research in several localities has been carried on
and many authentic specimens from the three layers
have been brought together.</p>
<p>The stratigraphic series concerns sedentary life
after the invention of agriculture. Presumably a
nomadic horizon preceded that of the first farmers,
but few traces of this have so far been reported from
southern Mexico and Central America. The earliest
known specimens of the lowest level are not rudimentary
but are well stylized, and opinions vary as
to the length of time necessary for a theoretical
formative stage. It seems necessary to consider
this old civilization as a stratigraphic unit admitting
the probability that true beginnings await the arch&aelig;ologist&rsquo;s
spade.</p>
<p>The culture of the lowest stratum is here called
archaic, a word meaning old, but not necessarily
primitive. The word &ldquo;horizon&rdquo; carries an implication
of chronological succession, but it would not be
wise to insist that archaic remains everywhere represent
a dead chronological level. Archaic art is
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
oldest in its place of origin, the highlands of Mexico
and Central America, and in or near this general
region, it was first succeeded by higher types. On
the margin of its distribution archaic art, or at
least the most striking traits of archaic art, lasted
into much more recent times, and in some places
may even have survived till the coming of the Spaniards.
Even when every allowance is made for independent
expressions which may find nearly the
same form, it seems that remarkable homogeneity
and continuity can be demonstrated for products of
the archaic civilization of the New World.</p>
<p>Most of the evidence of the old civilization consists
of ceramic objects, but there is also some stonework
including implements, ornaments, and crude
statues. Common household pottery shows local
variations, but as a rule the archaic wares can be
recognized as such by qualities of paste, shape, and
decoration. The motives are simply geometric or
realistic and there is a lack of formalized designs.
One process of decoration has wide distribution and
seems to have been invented well along in the archaic
period. This is the process of negative painting
in which the lines of the decorative pattern,
originally applied in wax or pitch, stand out in the
natural surface color of the pot against an over-painted
background. This &ldquo;batik&rdquo; pottery extends
from central Mexico to northern Peru.</p>
<p>The most interesting and important objects of
archaic art in clay are human figurines executed in
peculiar styles. These not only reflect details of
dress, etc., but also seem to stand for a set of religious
ideas. Especially a type of figurine representing
a nude female appears to be an agricultural
fetish, symbolizing the fecundity of Mother-Earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h3>Stratification of Remains.</h3>
<p>Atzcapotzalco was once
an important center of the Tepanecan tribe situated
on the shores of lake Texcoco. It was an early rival
of Tenochtitlan, the Aztecan capital, and was
conquered and partly destroyed in 1439. The principal
modern industry of Atzcapotzalco
is brick-making, and several
mounds and much of the surface of
the plain have been removed for this
purpose. In the mounds are found
many pottery objects of the late Toltecan
period, while on the surface of
the ground are encountered fragments
of the typical Aztecan pottery
in use when the Spaniards arrived.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 10. Atzcapotzalco
Destroyed.
The temple
burns at the
Place of the Ant.</p>
</div>
<p>The stratification of the plain varies
in different places so far as the
thickness of the different strata is
concerned, but the order is always
the same. At one locality it is as
shown in <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>. First comes a
layer of fine soil of volcanic ash origin,
probably deposited by the wind. This is five
or six feet in thickness, yellowish at the top, and
much darker towards the bottom, with streaks and
discolorations. The Aztecan pottery is found close
to the surface, while Toltecan pottery occurs in the
middle and lower sections. Underneath the soil
layers lies a thick stratum of water-bearing gravel
mixed with sand. This gravel stratum is possibly
the old bed of a stream that formerly entered Lake
Texcoco near this point. In some places it is fifteen
or eighteen feet in thickness. Scattered throughout
the gravel are heavy, waterworn fragments of pots
as well as more or less complete figurines of the
archaic type.</p>

<p>At other sites, such as Colhuacan, the Toltecan
layer is of greater thickness and the archaic layer
of lesser thickness. The remains extend below the
present level of the water and may indicate that
considerable changes have taken place in the level
of the lake. But we must remember that many of
the ancient settlements were built over the water
and that land was made in ancient times, as it is
today in the gardens of Xochimilco, by deepening
canals. Archaic remains are also common on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
denuded tops of hills which may once have been covered
by soil.</p>
<p>A stratification of arch&aelig;ological remains has recently
been determined in Salvador.</p>
<h3>The Cemetery under the Lava.</h3>
<p>An ancient cemetery
lying under lava has recently been explored in
Copilco, a suburb of Mexico City. The lava swept
down from Mount Ajusco in some cataclysm perhaps
3000 years ago, covering many square miles of
territory to the depth of thirty or forty feet, and
burying such villages as chanced to lie in its path.
(See <a href="#plVI">Pl. VI</a><i>b</i>). The discovery of human remains
was made several hundred feet back from the original
front of the lava flow in a quarry where lava
rock was being removed to build roads. Tales of
clay figurines found under the lava in this quarry had
been current for years, but no serious investigation
was made until human burials were met with in the
earth under the great lava cap. Then a series of
tunnels was dug and a considerable number of ancient
burials were uncovered, but not moved from
their original position. One now enters an electric-lighted
graveyard and sees human bodies lying
exactly as they have lain for untold centuries, with
the funeral offerings beside them. This enormously
important find gives us an historical level in mid-Archaic.</p>
<p>Another site, at Cuicuilco, on the opposite side of
the lava flow, has received attention from arch&aelig;ologists.
Here a great round mound rises in terraces
faced with cobblestones. It is surrounded by the
lava flow and some persons have assumed that the
mound was already abandoned and in decay when
the lava flow took place. Perhaps, however, the
mound was built on a piece of land that the lava flow
had spared. There are no contacts between the lava
and the mound except at the ends of two projecting
aprons or causeways. The pottery at this site is
sufficiently different from that found at Copilco.</p>

<h3>Invention of Agriculture.</h3>
<p>Before examining in
greater detail the art of the Archaic Horizon let us
consider its real significance.
It is generally
admitted that America
was originally populated
from Asia, but on a culture
level no higher than
the Neolithic. The simple
arts of stone chipping,
basketry, fire-making,
etc., were probably
brought over by the earliest
immigrants, but
there is abundant evidence
that pottery-making,
weaving, and agriculture
were independently
invented long after the
original settlement. The
cultivated plants in the New World are different
from those of the Old World and there is a vast area
in northwestern America and northeastern Asia,
upon the only open line of communication, where
agriculture and the higher arts have never been
practised.</p>
<div class="img" id="img25">
<img id="fig12" src="images/p015c.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 12. <i>Teocentli</i> or Mexican
Fodder Grass.</p>
</div>
<p>Now the invention of agriculture is an antecedent
necessity for all the high cultures of the New World.
It is equally clear that this invention must have
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
taken place in a locality where some important food
plant grew in a wild state. By far the most important
food plant of the New World is maize. While
this plant has changed greatly under domestication,
botanists are inclined to find its nearest relative and
possible progenitor in a wild grass growing on the
highlands of Mexico and known by the Aztecan
name <i>teocentli</i>, which means sacred maize. It is
known that maize is at its best in a semi-arid tropical
environment. It cannot be brought to withstand
frost although the growing season can be cut
down to meet the requirements of a short summer.
Geographically its use extended from the St. Lawrence
to the Rio de la Plata and from sea level to
an elevation of fifteen thousand feet in tropical
regions. The Mexican highlands occupy the central
position in the area of its distribution and arch&aelig;ological
evidence strongly points to this region as
being the cradle of agriculture and the attendant
arts. Besides maize, the most widely distributed
food plants of the New World are beans and
squashes. Certain other plants were cultivated in
more restricted areas and may have had different
places of origin. For instance, manioc was doubtless
brought under cultivation in a humid lowland
region, probably the Amazon Valley, and the same
may be said of sweet potatoes. The common potato
was found under domestication in Peru and
there is no very good evidence that its use extended
into Central America.</p>
<p>Irrigation would have been necessary before agriculture
could have been developed to any great extent
on the highlands of Mexico. Although irrigation
is often looked upon as a remarkable sequel of
the introduction of agriculture into an arid country,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
yet from the best historical evidence at our command
we should rather regard it as a conception
which accounts for the very origin of agriculture
itself. The earliest records of cultivated plants are
from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Mexico, and Peru where
irrigation was practised. In these regions are also
seen the earliest developments of the characteristic
arts of sedentary peoples, namely, pottery and
weaving, and the elaborate social and religious
structures that result from a sure food supply and
a reasonable amount of leisure.</p>
<p>If this theory is true we must admit that below
the Archaic Horizon we should find traces of a
horizon of non-agricultural peoples, living a nomadic
life without pottery. Unfortunately, such
peoples make fewer objects and scatter them more
widely than do sedentary agriculturists.</p>
<p>No one on the basis of present knowledge can offer
more than an opinion concerning the date of the
invention of agriculture in the New World. The
thick deposits left by the sedentary peoples argue
great age and the wide area of homogeneous products
argues slow change. In the most favored regions
archaic art may have been succeeded by higher
forms shortly before the time of Christ, and perhaps
5000 years is not too long a time to allow
for the diversities of the domesticated plants of
America.</p>

<p>Archaic art is characterized
by figures of men and women modeled in clay and
sometimes painted. The forms are peculiar and the
technique well standardized. Most are modeled in
a flat gingerbread fashion into a gross shape. Upon
this gross shape special features are indicated by
stuck-on ribbons and buttons of clay and by gougings
and incisings with some pointed instrument.
Modeling was done entirely by hand, moulds being
as yet unknown. The figurines are usually from
two to five inches in height and often represent nude
women in sitting or standing positions with the
hands upon the knees, hips, or breasts. The heads
are characteristically of slight depth compared with
their height, the limbs taper rapidly from a rather
plump torso and hands and feet are mere knobs with
incised details. When the figures are intended to
stand erect, as is often the case, the feet show signs
of having been pinched between the thumb and finger
of the potter so that they have a forward and
backward cusp and a broad base of support.
Groovings are seen in connection with the hair, eyes,
mouth, fingers, toes, and details of dress and ornament.
Paint is often added to this surface to
indicate tattooing, textile patterns, etc.</p>

</div>
<p>The eyes of the archaic images&mdash;and the mouths
as well&mdash;are made according to several methods.
First, there is the simple groove; second, a groove
across an applied ball or button of clay; third, a
round gouging made by the end of a blunt implement
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
held vertically; fourth, a round gouging in an
applied ball or button of clay; fifth, two gougings
made with a round or chisel-edged implement held
at an angle. The second form of eye, which resembles
a grain of coffee, and the fifth form with the
double gouging made from the center outward, are
found from the northern limits of archaic art in
Mexico as far south as Colombia and Venezuela.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 16. Types of Eyes of Archaic Figurines.</p>
</div>
<p>The technique of manufacture naturally changes
somewhat with the increase in size. There is also
reason to believe that the largest hollow figures
come from the end of the Archaic Period in Mexico,
and especially those that have been found in the
state of Jalisco and the territory of Tepic. The
eyelids are often rather carefully modeled and sometimes
an eyeball is put in between the lids. These
and perforated eyes seem to be the latest characters
to be developed in the archaic art and it is significant
that they are not found over such a wide area as the
first five types of eyes given above.</p>
<h3>Ancient Customs.</h3>
<p>We may gather much of an
ethnological nature from the study of these quaint
figures. Articles of dress and adornment are shown
as well as musical instruments, weapons, etc. Headdresses
may consist of fillets, turbans, and objects
perched on one side of the head. Noserings and
earrings are abundantly represented and in considerable
variety. We may be sure that weaving was
rather highly developed because many garments
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
such as shirts, skirts, and aprons are painted or
incised with geometric designs. Body painting, or
tattooing, appears to have been a common usage.
Among weapons the <i>atlatl</i>, or spear-thrower, was
already known and knobby clubs seem to have been
popular. Men are shown beating on drums and
turtle shells, while women nurse children and carry
water. Since the large figures of clay are often
found in tombs it is not impossible that they were
intended to be portraits of the dead. Many have a
startling quality of caricature.</p>
<div class="img" id="img31">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 17. Textile Designs painted on Archaic Effigies.</p>
</div>
<p>Archaic art is a pretty certain index of the religion
then in vogue. There is a notable absence of
purposely grotesque or compounded figures representing
divinities such as will be found in the later
horizons. We miss entirely the characteristic Mexican
gods such as Tlaloc and Ehecatl. Dogs are
frequently modeled in clay and were apparently
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
developed into a rather special domestic breed.
Snakes are sometimes found as a plastic decoration
on pottery but there are few signs of serpent worship.
We can find no evidence that human sacrifice
was practiced. The presence of human figurines in
graves has already been mentioned and the suggestion
made that some of them may have been intended
as portraits of the dead. Nude female figurines in
sitting or standing position have an unbroken distribution
from Mexico into South America and it is
not unlikely that the primitive agriculturists associated
them with fertility and used them as amulets
to secure good crops. The male figurines may have
been votive offerings for success at arms.</p>
<h3>Archaic Pottery.</h3>
<p>The ordinary pottery of the
Archaic Period from Mexico and Central America
is heavy and simple in shape. The globular bowl
with a constricted neck is a common form as well as
wide-mouthed bowls with or without tripod supports.
Lugs and handles are very common. When
plain, tripods are large, hollow and rounded,
with a perforation on the under side, but they are
often modified into faces and feet. Many vessels
are decorated by the addition of modeled faces enabling
us to make a direct connection with the figures
in clay already described.</p>

<p>In fact the decoration of pottery of this early period
is predominantly in relief. Paint is sparingly
used and then only in the simplest geometric fashion.
There is a general lack of conventionalized motives
presenting animals and other natural forms in
highly modified ways. In later ages the painted
decoration is much concerned with the serpent, but
except for a few winding serpents in relief, this
motive is not seen on the pottery of the Archaic
Period.</p>

<h3>Stone Sculptures of the Archaic Period.</h3>
<p>The earliest
stone sculptures are recognized first by resemblance
to the ceramic art just described and second
by a quality which they possess of being archaic in
an absolute sense. The greater difficulty of working
stone as compared with clay and the longer time
required in the process makes stone art less subject
to caprice than ceramic art. Perhaps the most
primitive examples of stone sculpture are boulders
rudely carved in a semblance of the human form
with features either sunken or in relief. The arms
and legs are ordinarily flexed so that the elbows
meet over the knees. The eyes and mouths in the
most carefully finished pieces protrude, but the face
has little or no modeling. Many celts are modified
into figures by grooves, and faces are frequently
represented on roughly conical or disk-shaped
stones.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>We know very little from actual excavations concerning
houses of the Archaic Period. It is likely
that they were small and impermanent, possibly resembling
the modern huts. The pyramidal mound
as a foundation for the temple may have been developed
towards the end of the Archaic Period. It
would be interesting to determine whether adobe
moulded into bricks was known at this time, as it
was at a later time in the same region, or whether
walls were built up out of fresh mud possibly reinforced
by slabs of stone.</p>
<h3>Extensions of the Archaic Horizon.</h3>
<p>The curious
objects of ceramic art that we have found deeply
buried under the d&eacute;bris of higher civilizations in the
Valley of Mexico can be traced far and wide. They
are encountered, for the most part, in arid and open
country, and since we have every reason to believe
that the earliest agriculture was developed under
irrigation, it is but natural to find the use of agriculture
spreading first into other arid regions. And
if there was an association between the fertility of
Mother-Earth and little fetishes representing
women then these fetishes would spread as part of
the agricultural complex.</p>
<p>It now seems possible that the cult of the female
figurine reached our Southwestern states on the
earliest level of agricultural life. In sites belonging
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
to Basket-Maker III&mdash;the arch&aelig;ological level of the
first Pueblo pottery&mdash;little female fetishes are found
and, indeed, are symptomatic of this early culture.
They are cruder than anything as yet found in Mexico,
but not necessarily older. With them occurs a
primitive maize doubtless introduced from the south.</p>
<p>In the Isthmian region, on the other side of the
Mexican and Central American cradle of New World
agricultural civilization, there are small figurines
quite similar to the archaic figurines of Mexico and
Salvador as regards pose and bodily proportions.
These are mostly on the level of the first Mayan
civilization even in cases where the coffee-grain eye
is used. Around the Nicaraguan lakes the figurines
of nude females were cast in moulds, a device entirely
unknown on the Archaic Horizon in Mexico.
In the Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica the figurines
are skilfully modeled with painted designs in black
on a dark brilliant red, which may represent tattooing.
In the Chiriqui Province of Panama the figurines
belong in a ceramic group characterized by
the use of highly conventionalized alligators or
crocodiles. It has already been stated that designs
of the Archaic Horizon in Mexico are either geometric
or na&iuml;vely realistic. There is another matter
that deserves attention: some of these southern
types of the female fetish occur in distinctly humid
lands and this, by itself, is a strong argument
against great antiquity.</p>
<p>The Isthmian female fetish must have been implanted
on the Archaic Horizon even though the
present examples are mostly from post-archaic
times. Perhaps future arch&aelig;ological investigation
will reveal early stations of a purely archaic type in
desert parts of Costa Rica and Panama. Till then
a controlling fact is that Mayan religious art avoids
all references to sex and cannot, therefore, possibly
be held responsible for the culture trait of the female
fetish. But this fetish does agree with a pre-Mayan
concept, as we have seen.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The ancient gold work of Costa Rica and Panama
also reflects the technique of archaic art, although
most of it, to judge by the religious significance of
many of the subjects and designs, was made long
after the Archaic Period. Just as the pottery figurines
were built up by the addition of ribbons and
buttons of clay to a generalized form so the patterns
for gold castings were made by adding details in
rolled wax or resin to a simple underlying form of
the same material.</p>
<p>In Colombia and Venezuela archaic art is common
in arid and mountainous territory. Local developments
confuse the issue of time. Various cultural
successions took place here, the Quimbaya, Sinu,
and Tairona Indians having developed civilizations
with possible Mayan affiliations in some features.
The archaic figurines of Colombia are decorated
with designs made by the process of negative painting
through the medium of wax. This process is
pretty generally distributed from central Mexico to
northern Peru. The indications are that it was invented
long before the rise of the Mayas, and once
invented remained popular.</p>
<p>As regards Venezuela the figurines of men and
women from the Eastern Andes are often strikingly
similar to those of Mexico, especially in such matters
as eyes made by double gougings. As a rule,
these figurines are painted. Around Lake Valencia
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
they are made without paint, but in combination
with pottery designs showing the beginnings of conventionalization.
Here there is added the circumstance
that wild Carib tribes, coming down the
Orinoco, drove the earlier inhabitants out over the
West Indies. This flight must have taken place
centuries before the coming of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>The arch&aelig;ology of the lower Amazon is best
known from the remains found on the Island of
Marajo where female figurines exhibit close similarity
in pose to specimens from Venezuela and
Mexico. This culture of Marajo seems to have been
disrupted before the coming of Europeans. But it
may be significant that crude fetishes representing
women are used at the present time by tribes on the
margins of the old Amazonian culture area. The
earliest level at Ancon, Peru, yields ware recalling
northern products. Nude females, apparently of
somewhat later time, however, are in standing
rather than sitting pose. It seems, then, that the
trail of dissemination of agriculture and the ancillary
arts can be followed across the northern part
of South America and southward along the Andes
to Peru. The greatest similarities must be sought
in the oldest objects and some leeway granted in the
case of marginal survivals.</p>
<p>It is proper to speak of agriculture, pottery-making,
and weaving as the great civilizing complex.
Few inventions could break down the ordinary
boundaries of language and environment, as these
had done. Yet, after the discovery of America, the
horse, introduced by the Spaniards, spread rapidly
through native tribes, modifying their lives greatly.
It is capable of demonstration that with the horse
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
went two types of saddle&mdash;the pack saddle and the
riding saddle. Similarly in the first rapid spread of
agriculture went pots and woven garments.</p>
<p>Two maps of the New World are given herewith:
the first showing the extent of the Archaic Horizon
and the second the final distribution of pottery
among the American Indians and the final distribution
of agriculture. The agricultural area is subdivided
according to, first, the arid land type where
irrigation is generally practised; second, the humid
land type; and third, the temperate land type. The
first type of agriculture appears to be the earliest
and the range coincides, for the most part, with the
range of the archaic pottery art.</p>

<br />THE MAYAN CIVILIZATION</h2>
<p>The wonderful culture of the Mayan Indians to
which we will now turn our attention was
developed in the humid lowlands of Central
America and especially in the Yucatan Peninsula.
Artists are everywhere of the opinion that the sculptures
and other products of the Mayas deserve to
rank among the highest art products of the world,
and astronomers are amazed at the progress made
by this people in the measuring of time by the observed
movements of the heavenly bodies. Moreover,
they invented a remarkable system of hieroglyphic
writing by which they were able to record
facts and events and they built great cities of stone
that attest a degree of wealth and splendor beyond
anything seen elsewhere in the New World.</p>
<p>The Mayan culture was made possible by the
agricultural conquest of the rich lowlands where
the exuberance of nature can only be held in check
by organized effort. On the highlands the preparation
of the land is comparatively easy, owing to
scanty natural vegetation and a control vested in
irrigation. On the lowlands, however, great trees
have to be felled and fast-growing bushes kept down
by untiring energy. But when nature is truly tamed
she returns recompense many fold to the daring
farmer. Moreover, there is reason to believe that
the removal of the forest cover over large areas affects
favorably the conditions of life which under a
canopy of leaves are hard indeed.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The principal crops of the Mayas were probably
much the same as on the highlands, with maize as
the great staple. Varieties favorable to a humid
environment had doubtless been developed from the
highland stock by selective breeding as agriculture
worked its way down into the lowlands. Archaic
art appears along the edges of the Mayan Area in
the state of Vera Cruz, Mexico, and in the Uloa Valley,
Honduras. In both these regions are also
found clay figurines that mark the transition in
style between the archaic and the Mayan, as well
as finished examples of the latter. There can be
no doubt, then, that the archaic art of Mexico marks
an earlier horizon than the Mayan. Whether or not
it was once laid entirely across the Mayan Area cannot
be decided on present data but it seems unlikely.
We have already seen that this first art was distributed
primarily across arid and open territory.</p>
<p>With their calendarial system already in working
order the Mayas appear on the threshold of history
600 years before the Christian Era, according to a
correlation with European chronology that will be
explained later. The first great cities were Tikal in
northern Guatemala and Copan in western Honduras,
both of which had a long and glorious existence.
Many others sprang into prominence at a
somewhat later date; for example, Palenque, Yaxchilan
or Mench&eacute;, Piedras Negras, Seibal, Naranjo,
and Quirigua. The most brilliant period was from
300 to 600 A. D., after which all these cities appear
to have been abandoned to the forest that soon
closed over them. The population moved to northern
Yucatan, where it no longer reacted strongly
upon the other nations of Central America and
where it enjoyed a second period of brilliancy several
hundred years later.</p>

<h3>Architecture.</h3>
<p>The idea of a civic center is admirably
illustrated in Mayan cities, particularly
those of the first brilliant period. The principal
structures are built around courts or plazas and
there is usually an artificial acropolis which is a
great terraced mound serving as a common base or
platform from which the individual pyramidal bases
of several temples rise. At some sites this acropolis
is a natural hill which has been trimmed down
or added to, but at other sites it is entirely artificial.
At Copan there is an especially fine example
of artificial platform mound rising from one end
of the Great Plaza and affording space for several
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
temples, as well as for sunken courts with stepped
sides that may have been theatres. The river washing
against one side of this great mound has removed
perhaps a third of it and made a vertical section
that shows the method of construction. It is
apparent that the mound was enlarged and old walls
and floors buried.</p>

</div>
<p>Mayan buildings are of two principal kinds. One
is a temple pure and simple and the other has been
called a palace. The temple is a rectangular structure
crowning a rather high pyramid that rises in
several steps or terraces. As a rule the temple has
a single front with one or more doorways and is
approached by a broad stairway. The pyramid is
ordinarily a solid mass of rubble and earth faced
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
with cement or cut stone and rarely contains compartments.
Some temples have but a single chamber
while others have two or more chambers, the
central or innermost one being specially developed
into a sanctuary. The so-called palaces are clusters
of rooms on low and often irregular platforms.
These palaces may have been habitations of the
priests and nobility. The common people doubtless
lived in palm-thatched huts similar to those used today
in the same region.</p>
<p>The typical Mayan construction is a faced concrete.
The limestone, which abounds in nearly all
parts of the Mayan Area, was burned into lime.
This was then slaked to make mortar and applied to
a mass of broken limestone. The facing stones
were smoothed on the outside and left rough hewn
and pointed on the inside. It is likely that these
facing stones were held in place between forms and
the lime, mortar, and rubble filled in between. The
resulting wall was essentially monolithic. The
rooms of Mayan buildings are characteristically
vaulted but the roof is not a true arch with a keystone.
The vault, like the walls, is a solid mass of
concrete that grips the cut stone veneer and that
must have been held in place by a false work form
while it was hardening. The so-called corbelled
arch of overstepping stones was doubtless known to
the Mayan builders but was little used. Taking the
single rectangular room as the unit of construction
the width was limited to the span of the vault, which
seldom exceeded twelve feet, while the length was
indeterminate.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The first variation from the temple with one
rectangular room was the two-roomed structure
with one chamber directly behind the other. In
this case there were two vaulted compartments
separated from each other by a common supporting
wall pierced by one or more doorways. The inner
room was naturally more dimly lighted than the other
one and as a result was modified into a sanctuary,
or holy of holies, enhanced by sculptures and paintings,
while the outer room developed gradually into
a portico. The outer wall was cut by doorways till
only pier-like sections remained, and finally these
piers were replaced by square or round columns.
The development of the Mayan temple may be
traced through a thousand years of change and
adjustment.</p>
<p>Much attention was paid by Mayan builders to
the question of stability which was accomplished
directly by keeping the center of gravity of the
principal masses within the supporting walls rather
than by the use of binding stones. The cross-section
of a two-roomed temple of late date will illustrate
how this was done. There are three principal
masses, one over the front wall, one over the medial
partition, and one over the back wall. The roof
where these sections join is of no great thickness.
The central mass is symmetrical and, if the mortar
has the proper cohesiveness, very stable. For the
front and back masses the projection of the upper
or frieze zone tends to counterbalance the overhang
of half the vault. In the earlier temples the upper
zone of the fa&ccedil;ade often slopes backward so that
the balance is not so perfect.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>So far we have given brief space to the question
of elevations. Taken vertically there are three
parts to the Mayan building: first, the substructure
or pyramidal base; second, the structure proper;
third, the superstructure. In the case of temples
the structure proper is one story in height. Two
and three stories are rather common in palaces, but
the upper stories are in most cases built directly
over a solid core and not over the rooms of the lower
story. The upper stories, therefore, recede, so that
the building presents a terraced or pyramidal profile.
One building at Tikal is five stories in height,
in three receding planes, the three uppermost stories
being one above the other. In a tower at Palenque
we have an example of four stories but this is
unusual.</p>
<p>On top of the building proper, especially if it is
a temple, we frequently find a superstructure. This
is a sort of crest, or roof wall, usually pierced by
windows. When this wall rises from the center
line of the roof it is called a roof comb or roof crest,
and when it rises from the front wall it is called a
flying fa&ccedil;ade. The highest temples in the Mayan
Area are those of Tikal that attain a total height of
about 175 feet, counting pyramid and superstructure.</p>
<h3>Massive Sculptural Art.</h3>
<p>The decoration of Mayan
buildings may be considered under three heads:
first, interior decoration; second, fa&ccedil;ade decoration;
third, supplementary monuments. In many temples
at Yaxchilan, Tikal, etc., are found splendidly
sculptured lintels of stone or wood. At Copan we
see wall sculptures that adorn the entrance to the
sanctuary and at Palenque finely sculptured tablets
let into the rear wall of the sanctuary. Elsewhere
are occasional examples of mural paintings, sculptured
door jambs, decorated interior steps, etc.</p>
<p>The fa&ccedil;ade decorations of the earlier Mayan
structures are freer and more realistic than those
of the later buildings. In many cases they consist
of figures of men, serpents, etc., modeled in stucco
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
or built up out of several nicely fitted blocks of
stone. Grotesque faces also occur. In the later
styles, decoration consists largely of &ldquo;mask panels,&rdquo;
which are grotesque front view faces arranged to
fill rectangular panels, but there is an increasing
amount of purely geometric ornament. The masked
panels represent in most instances a highly elaborated
serpent&rsquo;s face which sometimes carries the
special markings of one of the greater gods. These
panels, considered historically, pass through some
interesting developments. Angular representations
of serpent heads in profile are sometimes used at the
sides of doorways.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 22. Mask Panel over Doorway at Xkichmook. Yucatan.</p>
</div>
<p>The supplementary monuments are stel&aelig; and
altars. These are monolithic sculptures that are
often set up in definite relation to a building either
on the terraces or at the foot of the stairway. The
stel&aelig; are great plinths or slabs of stone carved on
one or more sides with the figures of priests and
warriors loaded down with religious symbols. The
altars are small stones usually placed in front of the
stel&aelig;. Many stel&aelig; and altars are set up in plazas
and have no definite architectural quality.</p>

<h3>Minor Arts.</h3>
<p>While the richly ornamented temples
and the great monoliths attract first attention
as works of art, the humbler products of the potter,
the weaver, and the lapidary also attained to grace
and dignity.</p>
<p>The Mayas were expert potters and employed a
variety of technical processes in the decoration of
their wares, such as painting, modeling, engraving,
and stamping. We can only take time to examine
a few examples of the best works, leaving the commoner
products practically undescribed. Suffice it
to say, that tripod dishes were much used, as well
as bowls, bottle-necked vessels, and cylindrical
vases, and that the common decorative use of hieroglyphs
serves to mark off Mayan pottery from that
of other Central American peoples. The realistic
designs are drawn in accordance with the highest
principles of decorative art. Serpents, monkeys,
jaguars, various birds, as well as priests and supernatural
beings, are used as subjects for pottery embellishment.
Geometric decoration is also much
used.</p>
<p>The polychrome pottery is rare and exceptionally
beautiful, with designs relating to religious subjects.
The background color of these cylindrical
vases is usually orange or yellow, the designs are
outlined in black, and the details filled in with delicate
washes of red, brown, white, etc. The surface
bears a high polish made by rubbing. <a href="#plXVIII">Plate XVIII</a>
reproduces the design units on two vases from
Cham&aacute;, Guatemala. The first example pictures a
seated man with a widespreading headdress made
of two conventional serpent heads from the ends
of which issue the plumes of the quetzal. The hieroglyphs
are Mayan day signs&mdash;Ben and Imix on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
left and Kan and Caban on the right. The second
example presents a god before an altar. This god
has the face of an old man and his body is attached
to a spiral shell. This divinity was probably associated
with the end of the year.</p>
<div class="img" id="img59">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 25. Mayan Basket represented in Stone Sculpture.</p>
</div>
<p>In the next illustration an engraved design on a
bowl from northern Yucatan is given. A jaguar
attired in the dress of man is seated in a wreath
of water lilies. After the vessel had been formed,
but before it had been fired, this design was made
by cutting away the background and incising finer
details on the original surfaces. Other designs in
relief were obtained by direct modeling or by
stamping. The stamps were moulds or negatives
made from bas-relief patterns.</p>
<p>The textile arts of the ancient Mayas can be recovered
in part from a study of the monuments since
the designs on many garments are reproduced in
delicate relief. The designs are mostly all-over
geometric patterns, but borders reproducing the
typical &ldquo;celestial band,&rdquo; a line of astronomical
symbols, are also seen. The techniques of brocade
and lace were understood by the ancient weavers.
In the minor textile art of basketry the products
must also have ranked high; a typical basket pictured
on a lintel is given in <a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Jade and other semi-precious stones were carved
by the Mayas into beautiful and fantastic shapes.
There was a considerable use of mosaic veneer on
masks and other ceremonial objects. Metal was
unknown during the first centuries of Mayan florescence,
later it was rare and could not be used for
tools, but the working of gold and copper in the
manufacture of ornaments was on a high plane.</p>
<p>Having now passed in brief review the objective
side of Mayan remains, let us turn our attention to
the subjective.</p>
<h3>The Serpent in Mayan Art.</h3>
<p>Mayan art is strange
and unintelligible at first sight, but after careful
study many wonderful qualities appear in it. In
the knowledge of foreshortening and composition,
the Mayas were superior to the Egyptians and Assyrians.
They could draw the human body in pure
profile and in free and graceful attitudes and they
could compose several figures in a rectangular panel
so that the result satisfies the eye of a modern artist.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately for our fuller understanding,
the human form had only a minor interest because
the gods were not in the image of man and the art
was essentially religious. The gods were at best
half human and half animal with grotesque elaborations.
The high esthetic qualities were therefore
wasted on subjects that appear trivial to many of
us. But, as we break away more and more from the
shackles of our own artistic conventions, we shall be
able to appreciate the many beauties of ancient
American sculpture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 26. Typical Elaborated Serpents of the Mayas. The serpent
with a human head in its mouth is from Yaxchilan. In this
example the writhing movements of the serpent&rsquo;s tail are probably
intended by the added scrolls. The plumed serpent is from Chichen
Itza.</p>
</div>
<p>The serpent motive controlled the character of
Mayan art and was of first importance in all subsequent
arts in Central America and Mexico. The
serpent was seldom represented realistically, and
yet we may safely infer that the rattlesnake was the
prevailing model. Parts of other creatures were
added to the serpent&rsquo;s body, such as the plumes of
the trogon or quetzal, the teeth of the jaguar, and
the ornaments of man. The serpent was idealized
and the lines characteristic of it entered into the
delineation of many subjects distinct from the serpent
itself. Scrolls and other sinuous details were
attached to the serpent&rsquo;s body and human ornaments
such as earplugs, noseplugs, and even headdresses
were added to its head. Finally, a human
head was placed in the distended jaws. The Mayas
may have intended to express the essential human
intelligence of the serpent in this fashion. The
serpent with a human head in its mouth doubtless
belongs in the same category as the partly humanized
gods of Egypt, Assyria, and India. It illustrates
the partial assumption of human form by a
beast divinity. The features combined are so peculiar
and unnatural that the influence of Mayan art
can be traced far and wide through Central America
and Mexico by comparative study of the serpent
motive.</p>

<p>A typical serpent head in profile (with the human
head omitted) as developed by the Mayas for decorative
purposes is reproduced in <a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a> with the
parts lettered and named. It will be noted that the
lines of interest in this design are either vertical or
horizontal, although the parts themselves have sinuous
outlines. Two features of the typical serpent&rsquo;s
body enter widely into the enrichment of all kinds of
subjects. One of these is the double outline which
is derived from the line paralleling the base of the
serpent&rsquo;s body and serving to mark off the belly
region. The second feature is the small circle applied
in bead-like rows to represent scales. The
profile serpent head is also seen in scrolls and frets
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
that elaborate many details of dress worn by the
human beings carved on the monuments. The front
view of the serpent&rsquo;s head is usually extended to
fill an oblong panel and is often used to decorate
the base of a monument or the fa&ccedil;ade of a building.
There are several monsters closely connected with
the serpent that will be discussed as the description
proceeds.</p>
<h3>The Human Figure.</h3>
<p>The human beings pictured
on Mayan monuments are captives, rulers, and
priests or worshippers. The captives are poor
groveling creatures, bound by rope, held by the hair
or crushed under foot to fill a rectangular space over
which the conqueror stands. The rulers and priests
are hard to distinguish from each other, perhaps because
the government was largely theocratic and the
ruler was looked upon as the spokesman of divinity.
The spear and shield of war served to mark off certain
human beings from others who carry religious
objects such as the Ceremonial Bar and the Manikin
Scepter.</p>

over by the arched body of the Two-headed
Dragon that bears symbols of the planets. Over
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
all is seen the great Serpent Bird with outstretched
wings. Upon the throne is seated a human being
who may safely be called a king and a line of footprints
on the front of the throne may symbolize
ascent. On other monuments the commanding personage
wears the mask of a god and wields a club to
subdue or scatters grain to placate. On the great
majority of monuments the human beings, richly
attired in ceremonial regalia and carrying a variety
of objects, possibly present the great warriors and
priests of the day. Many of the early sculptures
are stiff and formal, but in a number of instances
the quality of actual portraiture is convincing.</p>

<h3>Design, Composition, and Perspective.</h3>
<p>It is difficult
to compare directly the graphic and plastic arts
of different nations where the subject matter is
diverse unless we compare them in accordance with
absolute principles of design, composition, and perspective
drawing. The Mayas produced one of the
few really great and coherent expressions of beauty
so far given to the world and their influence in
America was historically as important as was that
of the Greeks in Europe. Set as we are in the matrix
of our own religious and artistic conventions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
we find it difficult to approach sympathetically
beauty that is overcast with an incomprehensible religion.
When we can bring ourselves to feel the
serpent symbolism of the Mayan artists as we feel,
for instance, the conventional halo that crowns the
ideal head of Christ, then we shall be able to recognize
the truly emotional qualities of Mayan sculptures.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>It is generally recognized that design to be successful
must contain order of various sorts (in
measurements, shapes, directions, tones, colors,
etc.). In the simpler forms of decorative art the
restrictions of technical process, as in basketry, may
impose order, but in freehand sculpture it must
come from an educated sense of beauty involving
selection and the reproduction of the finest qualities.
Design at its highest is embodied in the Mayan
hieroglyphs. Given spaces had to be filled with
given symbols and the results attained were uniformly
excellent. Although the influence of the serpent
led to the great use of tapering flame-like
masses in nearly all Mayan designs, still dominant
vertical and horizontal lines of interest were maintained.</p>
<p>The panel and lintel sculptures show composition
achieved by simple and subtle methods. The sweeping
plumes of headdresses were skilfully used to fill
in corners, while blocks of glyphs were placed in open
spaces that might otherwise distract the attention.
Many compositions appear overcrowded to us, but
this fault decreases with knowledge of the subject
matter. Also, the Mayas appear to have painted
their sculptures so that the details were emphasized
by color contrast.</p>
<p>In perspective as applied to the human figure
the Mayas were far ahead of the Egyptians and
Assyrians, since they could draw the body in front
view and pure profile without the distortions seen
in the Old World. They were even able to make
graceful approximations of a three-quarters view,
as may be seen in <a href="#plXIX">Plate XIX</a>, where the raising
of the nearer shoulder has a distinct perspective
value.</p>

</div>
<h3>The Mayan Pantheon.</h3>
<p>We have seen that during
the earliest culture of Mexico and Central America
there were no figurines of individualized gods,
simply straightforward representations of human
beings and animals. With the Mayan culture, however,
we enter upon an epoch of rich religious symbolism.
The serpent, highly conventionalized as we
have just seen, and variously combined with elements
taken from the quetzal, the jaguar, and even
from man himself, appears as a general indication
of divinity. The Ceremonial Bar, essentially a two-headed
serpent carrying in its mouths the heads of
an important god, is one of the earliest religious
objects. The heads that appear in the mouths are
usually those of a Roman-nosed or of a Long-nosed
god. Other representations of divinities are combined
with the Two-headed Dragon that also has
reptilian characters; still others appear as headdresses
and masks on human figures. Strange to
say, the gods are supplementary to the human figures
on all the early sculptures. In the codices,
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
however, they are represented apart from man, as
engaged in various activities and contests. Mayan
religion was clearly organized on a dualistic basis.
The powers for good are in a constant struggle with
the powers for evil and most of the benevolent divinities
have malevolent duplicates. In actual form
the gods are partly human, but ordinarily
the determining features are
grotesque variations from the human
face and figure. While beast associations
are sometimes discernible, they
are rarely controlling. Sometimes,
however, beast gods are represented
in unmistakable fashion, good examples
being the jaguar, the bat, and
the moan bird. All of these have human
bodies and animal heads.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 33. The Manikin Scepter, a Grotesque
Figure with one Leg modified into a Serpent.</p>
</div>
<p>The head position in the Mayan
pantheon may with some assurance
be given to a god who has been called
the Roman-nosed god and who is
probably to be identified with Itzamna.
According to Spanish writers Itzamna
was regarded by the Mayas as the creator
and father of all, the inventor of
writing, the founder of the Mayan civilization, and
the god of light and life. This Zeus of the Mayas
is represented in the form of an old man with a high
forehead, a strongly aquiline nose, and a distended
mouth, toothless, or with a single enlarged tooth in
front. On the ancient monuments he is frequently
seen in the mouths of the Ceremonial Bar and also
in association with the sun, moon, and the planet
Venus. In the codices he is shown as a protector
of the Maize God and in other acts beneficial to
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
man. There is, however, a malevolent aspect of
this god or possibly another being who imitates his
features but not his qualities. This being may be
an old woman goddess who wears a serpent headdress
and who is associated with destructive floods,
the very opposite of life-giving sunshine.</p>
<p>Of almost equal importance to the Roman-nosed
god is a god whose face is a more or less humanized
serpent. His proper name is Ah Bolon Dzacab.</p>

calamities at inferior conjunction of Venus and the Sun.
Copan.</p>
</div>
<p>On the early monuments this god is shown in connection
with the Ceremonial Bar. He also appears
at a somewhat later date as the Manikin Scepter,
an object in the form of a manikin that is held out
by a leg modified into a serpent&rsquo;s body. Since a
celt is usually worn in the forehead of the manikin
it has been suggested that this curious object represents
a ceremonial battle-ax. The face of the Long-nosed
god is frequently worn by high priests and
rulers either as a headdress or, more rarely, as a
mask. It is possible that this divinity was regarded
as primarily a war god but in the codices he is
evidently a universal deity of varied powers. Especially
he is shown in connection with water and
maize and it seems likely that his principal function
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
was to cause life-giving rain. A malevolent variant
of the Long-nosed god has a bare bone for the lower
jaw, a sun symbol on his forehead, and a headdress
consisting of three other symbols. This head is
associated with the Two-headed Dragon, a monster
which brings calamity at times of the inferior conjunction
of Venus and the Sun.</p>

<p>Ah Puch, the Lord of Death, was the principal
malevolent god. His body as figured in the codices
is a strange compound of skeletal and full-fleshed
parts. His head is a skull except for the normal
ears. His spinal column is usually bare and sometimes
the ribs as well, but the arms and legs are
often covered with flesh. As added symbols black
spots and dotted lines are sometimes drawn upon
his body and a curious device like a percentage sign
upon his cheek. The Death God in complete form
is rarely shown in the earlier sculptures, although
grinning skulls and interlacing bones occur as temple
decorations. As has already been pointed out,
Mayan religion was strongly dualistic and the evil
powers are usually to be identified by death symbols
such as a bare bone for the lower jaw, or the percentage
symbol noted above on the cheek. Death
heads of several kinds are frequent in the hieroglyphic
inscriptions.</p>

<p>The Maize God, figured so frequently on the ancient
monuments and in the Mayan codices may be
the same that in the time of the Conquest was called
Yum Kaax, Lord of the Harvest. He is represented
as a youth with a leafy headdress that is possibly
meant to represent an opening ear of maize. The
<i>kan</i> sign, a grain of maize, is constantly associated
with him. He appears to be at the mercy of the evil
deities when not protected by the good ones.</p>
<p>Space considerations forbid a further study of
Mayan gods. Suffice it to say that several other
divinities are shown in the sculptures and codices
including a somewhat youthful appearing war god,
as well as a more mature and grotesque war god
called Ek Ahau, the Black Captain. There is an
old god with a shell attached to his body, a god with
the face of a monkey who is associated with the
North Star, a god in the form of a frog and another
in the form of a bat. In the Spanish accounts we
can also glean scanty information concerning Ixchel,
Goddess of the Rainbow and mate of Itzamna;
Ixtubtun, patroness of jade carvers; Ixchebelyax,
patroness of the art of weaving and decorating cloth,
etc.</p>
<h3>How Mayan History has been Recovered.</h3>
<p>The arrangement
of Mayan remains on a time scale is now
an accomplished fact thanks to a correlation which
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
permits us to read the dates on ancient monuments
in terms of the Gregorian calendar and the Christian
era. Early attempts to achieve this result met with
widely varying results. Most of these attempts
were made by developing a single line of evidence
and some were based on assumptions that can now
be disproved. But no single line of evidence should
be deemed sufficient to decide this all important
question.</p>
<p>The general course of Mayan history is indicated
unmistakably by four principal lines of evidence
capable of being correlated with each other. These
are:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Stratigraphic sequences in pottery, stylistic sequences
in sculpture, structural sequences in architecture,
etc.</p>
<p>2. Traditional history preserved in the Books of
Chilam Balam and representing a knowledge of past
events at the time of the Spanish Conquest.</p>
<p>3. Dates inscribed on a great number of monuments
in terms of the ancient Mayan time counts.</p>
<p>4. Astronomical checks on these inscribed dates.</p>
<p>The artistic position of a monument may be used
to validate the contemporaneous character of an
inscribed date, otherwise interpretable as referring
to the past or future, or it may serve to fix a repeating
date in a single historical setting. The
events in the traditional history of the Books of
Chilam Balam, meager enough when taken alone,
have the valuable quality of reaching back into the
time of the First Empire when the use of dates on
temples and monuments was much in vogue. They
permit a richly documented past to be tied in, as it
were, to a poorly documented terminal period.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Before the matter of the ancient inscribed dates
can be understood, however, the somewhat complicated
mechanism of the Mayan calendar must be
explained, as well as the system of hieroglyphs and
the notation of numbers. Then there is the problem
of correlation which necessitates delicate adjudications
of evidence. Finally we must take up the
proofs which demonstrate the astronomical achievements
of the Mayas which, in reverse, provide
checks upon the correctness of the day for day
correlation itself. We must proceed slowly and
carefully, without much following of by-ways, however
attractive they may appear. We will begin
with stratigraphy and stylistic sequence.</p>
<h3>Sequences in Art.</h3>
<p>The study of Mayan ceramics
reveals developments as regard shapes, fabrics, and
designs. Specimens recovered from sealed cysts
under stel&aelig; at Copan establish true associations
with the higher forms of art and can be used far
and wide in comparison with pottery finds in Salvador,
Guatemala, etc. Vaillant has found stratigraphic
sequences in a collection of funerary vessels
obtained at Holmul, where graves occurred under
the floors and within the filled-in chambers of a
buried temple.</p>
<p>As regards sculpture we find at Copan a remarkably
homogeneous series of stel&aelig; on which a royal
or priestly personage stands erect and in front view.
A Ceremonial Bar is held symmetrically in the two
arms and the body is partly covered with rich and
elaborate ornament. The amount of relief, the proportions
of the body, the forms of the Ceremonial
Bar, etc., all pass through a harmonious development.
The earliest monuments show a crude block-like
carving of the face, with protruding eyes, while
the latest monuments have fully rounded contours.
At Tikal the stel&aelig; show, for the most part, human
figures in profile, but unmistakable development can
be seen in general quality of carving as well as in
specific details.</p>

<p>In making comparisons in art it is always necessary
to consider similar things. At many other
Mayan cities than the two named above it is possible
to obtain satisfactory evidence of sequence in art
forms by cutting out similar details from different
masses. Thus at Naranjo, when
we examine all the Ceremonial
Bars, we find a remarkable development
of flamboyant detail on
the later monuments. At Quirigua
the faces on the tops of the
altars may be compared with the
same result. At Piedras Negras
the heads of the Two-headed
Dragon that occur
in exactly
similar positions
on four
monuments
likewise show a
steady modification
towards
flamboyancy as
may be seen
from <a href="#fig36">Fig. 36</a>,
where the front
heads are put
side by side.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 38. Jaguar in Dresden Codex with a Water Lily attached to Forehead.</p>
</div>
<p>Still other lines of evidence on historical sequence are to be
gained from a study of architecture. Not only is
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
it possible to determine the general developments
that hold true of the entire Mayan Area but also in
a given city it is sometimes possible to arrange the
buildings in their order of
erection according to dependable
criteria, both decorative
and structural.</p>

</div>
<p>The earliest temples have
narrow vaulted rooms,
heavy walls, and a single
doorway. The rooms increase
in width, the walls
decrease in thickness, the
doorways multiply till the
spaces between them become
piers and finally columns.
The support for the
heavy roof comb taxed the
structural ingenuity of the
Mayan architects. The
solving of this problem is
marked by successive advances
and since mechanical
science goes forward
rather than backward the
relative order of structures is fairly certain. Moreover,
many buildings are closely associated with
dated monuments, tablets, lintels, or stel&aelig;. Still
another evidence of architectural sequence is seen
in structures that have been enlarged by the addition
of wings or by the enclosing of the old parts
under new masonry.</p>
<h3>Books of Chilam Balam.</h3>
<p>We now turn to a very
different kind of history, the digests of ancient
chronicles in the Mayan language but in Spanish
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
script which managed to survive in the so-called
Books of Chilam Balam along with other texts, ceremonial
and medical. There are five chronicles, the
two longest covering 68 katuns before the coming of
the Spaniards in 1517. We now know that these
katuns were time units consisting of 7200 days, or
nearly 20 years, and that they were designated by
their final day which was always a day called Ahau
associated with a number, 1 and 13, in a peculiar
sequence. A katun with the same designation returns
in 13 &times; 7200 days or about 256 years. Such
a completion, counted especially from a Katun 8
Ahau, was called the &ldquo;doubling back of the katuns&rdquo;
or, as we would say, the completion of a cycle. The
count of the katuns used in the chronicles was really
part and parcel of a fuller count just as a year &rsquo;22
implies a position in one of the centuries of our
Christian era.</p>
<p>The chronicles unfortunately give few names of
chieftains and cities and few outstanding events.
Chichen Itza is the city most fully concerned and
an early occupation is recorded, then an abandonment
for some two and a half centuries. After its
re-establishment the Toltecs enter Yucatan and
capture this capital. The first part of the chronicles
has the atmosphere of myth rather than history,
but a calendarial adjustment of some kind is mentioned
in one place. This was an event which took
place in 503 A. D. as we shall see in another place.</p>
<p>The first rough correlation between the time count
on the ancient monuments and the time count in the
chronicles was made on the theory that a dated
lintel at Chichen Itza had to be placed in the first
occupation of the city: when this was done the beginning
of the chronicles was found to proceed from
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
an important round number in the old day count
while the abandonment of Chichen Itza coincided
with the abandonment of all the cities of the Mayan
First Empire. We must now turn attention to the
famous calendar.</p>
<h3>The Mayan Time Counts.</h3>
<p>The passage of time,
seen in finer and finer degree in the course of human
life, the succession of summer and winter, the waxing
and waning moons, the alternation of day and
night, the upward and downward sloping of the sun,
and the swinging dial of the stars, are phenomena
that no human group has failed to notice. Longer
periods than those included within the memory of
the oldest men (presenting an imperfect reflection
of the memory of men still older) are found only in
those favored centers where a serviceable system of
counting has been developed. Mythology has a content
of history but hardly of chronology. Tradition,
when organized by the priesthood, may be reasonably
dependable for perhaps two hundred years.</p>
<p>The year and the month are the basis of all primitive
time systems, the former depending on the recurring
seasons, the latter on recurring moons.
Both of these are expressed in days. Unfortunately,
the day is not contained evenly in either the month
or the year, nor do these larger time measures show
any simple relation to each other as regards length.
The history of the calendar is one of compromise
and correction.</p>
<p>The Mayan calendars were made possible by:
first, the knowledge of astronomical time periods;
second, the possession of a suitable notation system;
third, the discovery of a permutation system of
names and numbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h3>Elements of the Day Count.</h3>
<p>There is reason to
believe that the Mayas had first a lunar-solar calendar
of twelve months of thirty days each, making
a year of 360 days, and that they reduced the number
of days in the formal month to 20 and raised
the number of months in the year from 12 to 18.
These changes permitted a close adjustment of the
units of time with their vigesimal system of counting.
With a truer knowledge of the length of the
year an extra five day month was added to make a
year of 365 days. Beyond this the &ldquo;leap year&rdquo;
error was calculated but not interpolated. As proof
that the lunar month of thirty days preceded the
formal month of twenty days, it need only be pointed
out that the name for this period, <i>uinal</i>, seems to be
connected with the name for moon, <i>u</i>, and that the
hieroglyph for moon has the value, twenty, in the
inscriptions and ancient books.</p>
<div class="img" id="img82">
<img id="fig40" src="images/p043.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="312" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 40. The Twenty Day Signs. The first example in each
case is taken from the inscriptions and the second from the codices.</p>
</div>
<p>Before entering into a fuller discussion of the
astronomical and notational facts let us turn for
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
a moment to the third fact, the permutation system.
The origin of the cycle<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> known by the Mayan name
<i>tzolkin</i> and the Aztecan name <i>tonalamatl</i>, book of
the days, has never been satisfactorily explained.
It is a permutation system with two factors, 13 and
20. The former is a series of numbers (1-13) and
the latter a series of twenty names as follows:&mdash;</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Imix</dt>
<dt>2. Ik</dt>
<dt>3. Akbal</dt>
<dt>4. Kan</dt>
<dt>5. Chicchan</dt>
<dt>6. Cimi</dt>
<dt>7. Manik</dt>
<dt>8. Lamat</dt>
<dt>9. Muluc</dt>
<dt>10. Oc</dt>
<dt>11. Chuen</dt>
<dt>12. Eb</dt>
<dt>13. Ben</dt>
<dt>14. Ix</dt>
<dt>15. Men</dt>
<dt>16. Cib</dt>
<dt>17. Caban</dt>
<dt>18. Eznab</dt>
<dt>19. Cauac</dt>
<dt>20. Ahau</dt></dl>
<p>These two series revolve upon each other like two
wheels, one with thirteen and the other with twenty
cogs. The smaller wheel of numbers makes twenty
revolutions while the larger wheel of days is making
thirteen revolutions, and after this the number cog
and name cog with which the experiment began are
again in combination. Thus, a day with the same
number and the same name recurs every 13 &times; 20 or
260 days.</p>
<p>This 260 day cycle corresponds to no natural time
period and is an invention pure and simple. It is
the most fundamental feature of the Mayan time
count and of the time counts of other nations in
Mexico and Central America. We may perhaps
assume that the twenty names were originally those
of the twenty days in the modified lunar months.
But the thirteen numbers have no recognized prototype.
The formal book of days generally was considered
to begin with 1 Imix for the Mayas and with
a corresponding day for the other Mexican and
Central American nations. But it can be made to
begin anywhere and proceed to an equivalent station
that is always 260 days removed.</p>

<h3>The Conventional Year.</h3>
<p>It has been stated that
the Mayas arrived at a conventional 365 day year
made up of eighteen months of twenty days each
plus a short period of five days that fell after the
eighteen regular months had been counted. The
Mayan month names are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>

</div>
<p>Since there are twenty days or positions in the
month and likewise twenty distinct day names in the
<i>tzolkin</i>, falling in regular order, it follows that each
day would always occupy the same month position
were it not for the offset at the end of each year
caused by the short Uayeb period. As it is, any
day name occupies the same month position during
the course of an entire year and a position five days
in advance during the course of the following year.
Since five is contained four times in twenty there
can be only four shifts, the fifth year showing the
same arrangement as the first. The following table
gives the month positions of each day name during
the changes of four consecutive years as these are
recorded in the ancient inscriptions.</p>

the Codex Tro-Cortesianus. In the center is Itzamna, the God of
the Sky, and his spouse, under what has been called the celestial
tree. The band of hieroglyphs that frames in this picture contains
the twenty day signs of the Mayan month. The figures on the outside
are arranged in four groups, according to the four directions
of the compass. At the top or east we again see Itzamna and his
mate. In the north, or right hand quarter, human sacrifice is
shown and the Death God sits opposite the God of War. In the
east and in the south are also shown pairs of divinities. A series
of dots running from one day sign to another covers the <i>tzolkin</i>
or 260 day cycle of names and numbers.</p>

<p>Thus Ik occupies 0 position the first year, 5, the
second year, 10 the third, 15 the fourth, and 0 the
fifth. While Manik that belongs to the same set
has position 5 the first year, 10 the second, etc. It
will be noted that Imix, the first day of the formal
permutation of the <i>tzolkin</i> is never the first day of
a month.</p>
<h3>The Calendar Round.</h3>
<p>But this assignment of
particular day names to particular places in the
month does not close the problem. Each day name
is associated in the <i>tzolkin</i>, or permutation, with a
day number. While it is true that each day can
occupy only four month positions in as many years,
it must be remembered that the day numbers associated
with these names can run the whole gamut of
13 changes. Thus, although Ik must always occupy
the fifth position in the months during a certain
year, nevertheless it will have numbers which fall
in the sequence 1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 10, 4, 11, 5, 12, 6, 13, 1,
etc. The complete cycle of variations must run
through the least common multiple of 260 (the permutation)
and 365 (the conventional year) or 18,980
days. This cycle is commonly known as the Calendar
Round. A Mayan day fixed in a month, or
let us say a calendar round date, has four parts to
its name, thus, 11 Ahau 18 Mac. We describe a
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
day as Tuesday, July 4, meaning &ldquo;Tuesday the third
day of the seven day week occupies the fourth position
in the month of July.&rdquo; Similarly the Mayan
date 11 Ahau 18 Mac may be read &ldquo;the day named
Ahau as eleventh day in a thirteen day week occupies
the eighteenth position in the month Mac.&rdquo;
Owing to leap year corrections the European date
given above does not recur at regular intervals, but
a Mayan day recurs infallibly in 52 calendar years,
never sooner, never later.</p>
<p>So far we have considered two kinds of Mayan
dates, first the <i>tzolkin</i> date, recurring every 260
days, secondly the calendar round date recurring
every 18,980 days. Before we can understand a
third and much more important kind of date, namely
a date which states, in addition to the calendar
round designation, the total number of days since a
beginning day called 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, located far
in the past, we must direct our attention to the
matter of numbers and notation.</p>
<h3>Mayan Numbers.</h3>
<p>The three most common numerical
systems in use in the world are all derived
from man&rsquo;s anatomy. The quinary system is based
on counting the fingers of one hand, the decimal
system on counting those of both hands and the
vigesimal system, which prevailed in Central America,
is based on counting all the fingers and all the
toes. The vigesimal system is seen in imperfect
form in our count of scores, where seventy years are
three score and ten.</p>
<p>The Mayan name for one was <i>hun</i>: they had simple
names to 9 and composite ones from 10 to 19,
much as in English, and twenty was <i>hun kal</i>, one
score. The ascending values in the vigesimal scale
were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<table class="center" summary="">

</table>
<p>They invented signs for zero and discovered the
principle of &ldquo;local value&rdquo; in the writing down of
numbers centuries before these ideas (which are
fundamental to higher mathematics) were known in
the Old World. The notation of numbers had its
simpler and more complicated phase. In the simpler
phase 1 was represented by a dot, 2 by two dots,
5 by a bar, 6 by a bar and dot, 15 by three bars, etc.
The commonest sign for zero was a shell while a
picture of the moon stood for twenty. In the more
elaborate notation a series of twenty faces of gods
represented the numerals from 0 to 19.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 42. Bar and Dot Numerals of the Mayas.</p>
</div>
<p>The straight vigesimal system was doubtless used
by the Mayas in ordinary counting, but in counting
time a very important change was introduced in the
third position. Also the names were modified: <i>hun</i>
was called <i>kin</i> which means sun or day. In the
second position <i>kal</i> was called <i>uinal</i> which means
month and 18 of these were taken to form a <i>tun</i>,
stone, which was the third unit. The <i>tun</i> then had a
value of 18 &times; 20 = 360 days, making a conventional
year about five and a quarter days less than a true
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
year. Twenty <i>tuns</i> made a <i>kaltun</i> or <i>katun</i> and
above this period the numeral system proceeded as
before and in the ascending values the names already
given were merely combined with <i>tun</i>, if
Gates is right in his clever suggestion. For years
it has been customary to speak of the fifth period
as cycle for want of a native term: this will
now be called <i>baktun</i>. One <i>hablatun</i>, the highest
period with a name, has the astonishing value of
460,800,000,000 days. However, the highest numbers
fall considerably short of this potential limit.</p>
<p>In our decimal system the number 347,981, for
instance, is really:&mdash;</p>

<p>When written out in a horizontal line each &ldquo;position&rdquo;
has a value ten times that of the &ldquo;position&rdquo;
to the right of it. It is understood that a digit
which stands in a &ldquo;position&rdquo; is to be multiplied by
1, 10, 100, 1000, etc., as the case may be. The
Mayas, using the principle of position, ordinarily
write their bar and dot numerals in columns. But
we can partially transcribe a Mayan number in
imitation of our own system by putting dots or
dashes between the positions or periods. The number
in five positions given below is transcribed as
9.12.16.7.8.</p>

<p>We read this date: 9 baktuns, 12 katuns, 16 tuns, 7
uinals, and 8 kins. It is convenient to remember

less than 20 years and a baktun a little less than
400 years. But the count is really of days, not

<h3>The Long Count.</h3>
<p>Many early monuments of the
Mayas have inscriptions with an enlarged Introducing
Glyph containing a variable element indicating
the title or principal subject matter of the inscription.
Next follows the number of elapsed days
from the epoch of a Mundane Era. This starting
point is uniformly the day 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu and the
complete Initial Series date not only states the number
of elapsed days, but also the name and number
of the day reached and its position in a Mayan
month.</p>
<p>The Initial Series is normally followed by a Supplementary
Series which concerns the lunar calendar,
and often there are numbers of days to be
added to or subtracted from the Initial Series date:
these are called Secondary Series. Also Period
Ending dates are used, these being merely abbreviated
dates which correspond to indicated round
numbers in the day count.</p>
<p>The Initial Series analyzed in <a href="#plXXIII">Plate XXIII</a> actually
records the number 1,401,217. This number
does not, however, reach the day 12 Caban declared
immediately after it or the month position 5 Kayab
recorded in glyph 10b. When 13 tuns are corrected
to 12 tuns on the theory that the sculptor did not
follow copy, we do reach 12 Caban 5 Kayab. Another
check comes when we add the Secondary
Series of 2423 days and reach 4 Ahau 13 Yax ending
an even katun.</p>
<h3>Dates of Dedication.</h3>
<p>Initial Series dates are
especially common on stel&aelig; at cities of the First
Empire, mostly located in the southern part of the
Mayan Area. While it is impossible to read much
of the texts which accompany these dates nevertheless
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
it is a remarkable fact that when we arrange the
monuments in their artistic order we find that the
inscribed dates in the great majority of cases fall in
the same order. This leads us to conclude that the
dates are practically contemporaneous with the
carving and setting up of the monuments. Now the
above is especially true when the inscription gives
a simple Initial Series date. When more than one
date is given the historic one appears in most instances
to be the latest, but in a few instances it appears
to be a specially emphasized intermediate
date. In addition, then, to contemporaneous dates
there are some that refer to the past and others that
refer to the future.</p>
<p>Some writers have assumed that the stel&aelig; and
other inscribed monuments were primarily time
markers set up at the end of hotun (or five year)
periods. This seems an unnecessarily narrow view.
We can demonstrate that some inscriptions deal
with astronomical facts covering long stretches of
time. It is also apparent that many of the sculptures
represent conquests and it is extremely likely
that portraits of actual rulers are to be seen in
certain carvings. It would be too much to expect
events to happen regularly at the end of time periods
and as a matter of fact we find at different
cities repeated dates that do not occupy such positions.
These repeated dates would seem to recall
events of special importance to the city in question.</p>
<p>The running co-ordination between the apparent
order of the artistic styles and inscribed dates permits
us to measure very accurately the rate of
change in art which was rapid, indeed, at certain
times. The style of carving, on the other hand,
enables us to put into definite 52 year periods many
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
of the calendar round dates&mdash;if these are to be regarded
as contemporaneous. The result is that for
the First Empire, as it has been called, there is an
exceedingly accurate chronology. After the fall
and abandonment of the great southern cities dates
are rare and we have to fall back upon remnants of
history preserved after the coming of the Spaniards.</p>
<h3>Hieroglyphs.</h3>
<p>Mayan hieroglyphs resemble the
Egyptian and Chinese hieroglyphs only in being
&ldquo;sacred writing&rdquo; that is not based upon an alphabet.
The styles and symbols are entirely different.
No Rosetta Stone has yet been discovered to give
us inscriptions in more than one system of writing
in Central America. The great use of hieroglyphic
inscriptions on monuments was characteristic of the
earlier period of Mayan history and at a later time
the writing was reduced to books. Bishop Landa
obtained what he supposed was a Mayan alphabet,
but what he really obtained was a list of signs representing
among other sounds the particular sounds
he had asked for.</p>
<p>The phonetic use of syllables rather than of simple
sounds or letters is probably an important feature
of Mayan writing. Many hieroglyphs are pictographic
and consist of abbreviated pictures of the
thing intended or of some object connected with it.
Often a head stands for the entire body. The following
list practically exhausts our knowledge of
Mayan hieroglyphs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The signs for the twenty named days of the
calendar.</p>
<p>2. The signs for the nineteen months of the
Mayan year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>3. The face signs for numbers from zero to nineteen
inclusive.</p>
<p>4. Period glyphs in two styles for place values in
the numerical notation.</p>
<p>5. The symbols for the four directions and for
the colors associated with them.</p>
<p>6. The hieroglyphs of several gods and ceremonies.</p>
<p>7. The symbols of Heaven and Earth, the Sun,
Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and a few astronomical
phenomena such as conjunctions.</p>
<p>8. Hieroglyphs for special times of the year such
as solstices and equinoxes.</p>
<p>9. Signs meaning era, or base from which a numerical
count is made, completion, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of these have recently been solved, thanks
to mathematical and astronomical calculations, others
rest on the calendarial forms given by Landa.
There are some phonetic elements in Mayan writing
and some ideographic elements. It seems likely
that the gist of the Mayan inscriptions which deal
with history will be solved in somewhat the same
fashion as those that deal with astronomy. The
matter is, however, most perplexing. So far not
a single place name or personal name has been
definitely recognized and translated. In spite of
the hundreds of glyphs recovered at the sites called
Copan and Palenque, for instance, we do not know
the real names of these cities or even their symbols.
We may expect to find signs referring to tribute
and common objects of trade and others referring
to birth, death, establishment, conquest, destruction,
and other fundamentals of individual and social
existence. These signs, taken with directives, connectives,
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
and dates, would make possible the recovery
of the main facts of history. There seems
no possibility of purely literary inscriptions.
While progress necessarily will be slow there is
no reason for despair and without doubt the greater
portion of Mayan inscriptions will finally be deciphered.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 47. Hieroglyphs containing the Phonetic Element <i>kin</i>:
<i>a-b</i>, <i>kin</i>; <i>c</i>, <i>li-kin</i>; <i>d</i>, <i>chi-kin</i>; <i>e-f</i>, <i>yax-kin</i>; <i>g</i>, <i>kan-kin</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>As an example of the phonetic use of signs in the
building up of hieroglyphs let us take the common
sign <i>kin</i>, meaning &ldquo;sun.&rdquo; This sign appears regularly
in the glyphs for the world directions east and
west, the Mayan names being <i>likin</i> and <i>chikin</i>, and
also in the month sign <i>Yaxkin</i>, and sometimes in
that for <i>Kankin</i>. It also appears as the sign for
the lowest period in the time count having the value
of a single day and called <i>kin</i> (<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a>). Now this
kin sign also appears in many undeciphered hieroglyphs
and in some of these it seems likely that it
has a phonetic value. Other signs with definite
values in several glyphs are <i>yax</i>, <i>tun</i>, <i>zac</i>, etc. This
general method of writing is seen in more decipherable
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
form among the Aztecs. The glosses of the
early priests that have proved so great a help in
the case of the Aztecan writing are absent from the
few Mayan documents.</p>
<h3>Codices.</h3>
<p>Only three ancient Mayan books or
codices are known to exist and these are more or
less incomplete. They have all been reproduced
in facsimile and are known by the following names:
Dresden Codex, Peresianus Codex, Tro-Cortesianus
Codex.</p>
<p>These illuminated manuscripts are written on
both sides of long strips of amatl paper, folded like
Japanese screens. The paper was given a smooth
surface by a coating of fine lime and the drawings
were made in black and in various colors. From
the early accounts we know that books were also
written on prepared deerskin and upon bark. Concerning
their subject matter we are told that the
Mayas had many books upon civil and religious
history, and upon rites, magic, and medicine. The
three books named above have been carefully studied.
They treat principally of the calendar and of
associated religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>A page of the Dresden Codex containing some interesting
calculations is reproduced herewith. The
numbers with the digits one above the other are
transcribed in two diagrams. In the upper diagram
the bar and dot numerals are simply put over into
Arabic numerals and the Mayan system of periods
or positions is retained. In the lower diagram
these numbers are reduced entirely to the Arabic
system. The columns are lettered at the top, the
hieroglyphs are counted off in sixteen rows at the
left and the separate groupings of numbers are
shown in five sections at the right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Among the hieroglyphs the Venus sign is especially
prominent. At the base of column B is given
a number in five periods that, counted from the
normal beginning day 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu leads again
to this day which is recorded at the bottom of column
A. The long number in column C, similarly
counted from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, leads to 1 Ahau 18
Kayab, recorded at the bottom of B. The day 1
Ahau 18 Uo is reached by another calculation which
will be explained later. At the base of A is a
number in three periods which amounts to 2200.
Not only is this the difference between the long
numbers in B and C (1,366,560 - 1,364,360 = 2200)
but it is also the number of days by which 1 Ahau
18 Kayab precedes 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. In other
words we deal in this passage with the end of the
seventy-second calendar round after the original
4 Ahau 8 Cumhu and with a new point of departure
2200 days earlier, which is some way involved with
the calendar of Venus.</p>
<p>Let us now make a new beginning in the lower
left hand corner of this page. In G5 we find the
number 2920 which as we have already seen is exactly
the number of days consumed in eight years of
365 days or five synodic revolutions of Venus of 584
days. We will now see how the Mayan scholars
arrived at 13 &times; 2920 or 37,960, the calendar round
of Venus. If we proceed towards the left in section
5 we find the second number, F5, is 5840 which
equals 2 &times; 2920, the third is 8760 or 3 &times; 2920, and
the fourth is 11,680 or 4 &times; 2920. The addition is
continued in sections 4 and 3 till we reach 35,040
or 12 &times; 2920. To be sure the scribe made a slight
error in one place, writing a 5 for an 8 but this is
caught up by the day signs 9 Ahau, 4 Ahau, 7 Ahau,
12 Ahau, etc., that fall at regular intervals of 2920
days.</p>

<p>From section 3, the calculation jumps to section
1 where the numbers in the original are partly destroyed.
They have, however, been restored with
perfect assurance since the days in all instances are
1 Ahau and therefore must be separated by multiples
of 260 days. The number in G1 has been
restored as 5-5-8-0 or 37,960 or 13 &times; 2920. It contains
260 an even number of times and therefore
every successive period of 37,960 days begins with
the same day, 1 Ahau. It also equals 13 &times; 8 &times; 365
days or 104 years and 13 &times; 5 &times; 584 days or sixty-five
revolutions of Venus.</p>

while the one on the right plays a flageolet. The sound
is indicated by scrolls. The head on the pyramid is that
of the Maize God and it rests upon the sign <i>caban</i>, meaning
earth.</p>
</div>
<p>The three numbers to the left in F1, E1, and D1
are respectively 2, 3, and 4 times 37,960. The last
number, 151,840 days is therefore equal to 416 years
or exactly 8 calendar rounds of 18,980 days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The numbers in section 2 are more difficult to
explain but they possibly have to do with corrections
and correlations of astronomical periods. If
we add to 1 Ahau 18 Kayab the number of days in
E2, (68900), we arrive at a day 1 Ahau 13 Mac.
This day is prominent in more detailed calculations
elsewhere in the Dresden Codex. If we add to the
same 1 Ahau 18 Kayab the number in D2 we arrive
at 1 Ahau 18 Uo recorded at the bottom of C.
Space permits no further explanation but the reader
will see from the foregoing the method of experiment
and cross checking that must be applied to the
decipherment of the Mayan manuscripts. Fortunately,
the relationships of numbers are absolute
and the coincidences between the recorded numbers
and astronomical periods are too close and frequent
to be dismissed as accidental.</p>
<p>In addition to rational calculations dealing with
astronomy one sees in the Mayan manuscripts many
arrangements of the <i>tzolkin</i> supposed to bring to
light good and bad days and to forecast events. A
section of the Dresden Codex showing a condensed
<i>tzolkin</i> is presented along with a diagram of its
parts. At the top and right are seventeen hieroglyphs
containing the symbols of the four directions,
and of at least three of the principal gods.
At the right is a column of five day signs with the
number 3 at the head of the column. The permutation
is divided into five parts of fifty-two days each
and each part is subdivided into four groups of
thirteen days each. It begins with 3 Akbal, the day
sign at the top of the column, and after the four
subdivisions of thirteen days each have been
counted we arrive at the day 3 Men, the second day
sign in the column. The count is repeated till the
260 days have been exhausted and we come back
again to 3 Akbal. In the diagram the red numbers
of the codex are represented by Roman numerals
and the black numbers by Arabic numerals. Since
the count in this example begins with 3 and the
addition is always 13, or exactly one round of numbers,
the resultant days always have the number 3.</p>

<p>The three pictures of gods give us an inkling into
the significance of this particular table of chances.
All of the gods carry the <i>kan</i> or maize sign in their
hands. The first god is the benevolent rain god and
the third is the benevolent sun god. Between them
is seated the malevolent goddess of floods with a
serpent on her head. The maize god is not shown
but his hieroglyph is given. This <i>tzolkin</i> probably
deals with agriculture and may be an attempt to
determine lucky days for planting.</p>
<h3>Correlation with Christian Chronology.</h3>
<p>The day
for day correlation rests broadly on the placing of
the date on the Lintel of the Initial Series at
Chichen Itza in the first occupation of that city
according to the chronicles. More specifically it
rests upon statements in Mayan and Spanish documents
relating to the completion of tuns and katuns
in the never-languishing day count. Also consideration
must be given the so-called Year-Bearers,
these being the first days of current years which
furnish the designations for such years. Bishop
Landa has a specimen Mayan year with its equivalent
days in the Spanish calendar; this is the year
12 Kan corresponding to 1553-1554 A. D. and the
day 12 Kan is found in the Long Count position
12.9.17.9.4, 12 Kan 2 Pop, July 26, 1553, Gregorian
Calendar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h3>The Mayan Eras.</h3>
<p>The zero of the Mayan day
count, reached by subtracting 12.9.17.9.4 or 1,799,104
days from the position declared above, is shown
to be October 14, 3373 B. C. in the backward projection
of the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian
readings are preferable to the Julian because they
preserve the actual times in the tropical year, but
it is sometimes useful to use the days of the Julian
Period which can always be found by adding 489384
to the Mayan number.</p>
<p>Now Mayan history does not reach back to the
zero date which must be regarded as a theoretical
beginning or Mundane Era. The earliest object
with a contemporary date is the Tuxtla Statuette
with May 16, 98 B. C. It appears, however, that
the really historic beginning of the day count was
7.0.0.0.0, 10 Ahau 18 Zac, August 6, 613 B. C. The
calendar of months was probably inaugurated in
580 B. C. when 0 Pop, New Year&rsquo;s day, coincided
with the winter solstice. A third era, 9.0.0.0.0, 8
Ahau 13 Ceh, February 10, 176 A. D., is the one
used in the Mayan chronicles.</p>
<h3>Astronomical Checks on the Correlation.</h3>
<p>The
first astronomical checks which develop from the
correlation explained above are dates which reach
the equinoxes, solstices, etc., further marked by
special hieroglyphs which are to be explained as
ideographs of these stations in the natural year.
For instance the most emphatic date in the three
famous temples of the Sun, the Cross, and the Foliated
Cross at Palenque is one written 9.12.18.5.16,
2 Cib 14 Mol, September 23, 430 A. D., which coincides
with the autumnal equinox. In connection
with this repeated date we find two glyphs both of
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
which are admirable ideographs of the equinox.
One is Ahau, a face explained as that of the Lord
of Day, but here half covered with starry eyes, and
the other is the Kin or sun symbol, half darkened
with cross-hatching. At Comitan a round number
date exactly coinciding with the equinox has a variant
of this second ideograph.</p>
<p>Other strong proofs concern Venus and the Moon.
Hieroglyphs of these heavenly bodies are found in
combination with dates and these later actually
reach significant phases of the planets in question.
For Venus the phase chosen is commonly the first
appearance as Morningstar four days after inferior
conjunction, or what is known as the heliacal rising.
Records of the Moon are prominent when a new or
full phase coincides with a round number in the
day count.</p>
<h3>Astronomical Observatories.</h3>
<p>One of the most interesting
pieces of evidence in support of the correlation
explained above has to do with a giant sun
dial at Copan. Two stel&aelig; stand on opposite sides
of the valley establishing a line which runs about
9 degrees north of west. When observation is made
from the eastern marker the sun sets behind the
western stone two times during the course of a year,
once shortly after the vernal equinox and once
shortly before the autumnal equinox. Now the
Mayan chronicles state that the calendarial New
Year was &ldquo;counted in order&rdquo; during a certain Katun
13 Ahau which extended from 491 A. D. to 511
A. D. Altar U at Copan was observed to record
two New Year&rsquo;s dates equaling April 9 in conjunction
with another date, equaling September 2, 503
A. D., and falling in the required interval covered
by Katun 13 Ahau. These dates were such as
might be reached by just such a base line as exists
at Copan and it was first believed that they were
exactly reached by it. Careful reconsideration of
the evidence in the inscriptions and a re-survey of
the line of sight led to the interesting conclusion
that the sun dial of Copan was originally set up in
392 A. D. to give sunset coincidences on April 5 and
September 6. About 490 A. D. the stones were re-adjusted
to give the April 9 and September 2 which
are recorded on Altar U and still later a third and
present arrangement was effected giving April 12
and August 30. Each pair of dates is &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo;
in the sense that one member marks the same interval
after the Spring equinox that the other does
before the Fall equinox. The shifting seems to
have been decided upon by astronomical congresses,
and the purpose was to fix propitious times of planting
the crops.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 49. Diagram of the Astronomical Base Line at Copan
giving readings at April 9 and September 2. Slight shifts were
made in this line: at an early time it was arranged to read
April 5 and September 6 and at a later time April 12 and
August 30.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Other Mayan observatories at Uaxactun and
Chichen Itza have lines of sight which mark exactly
the positions of the sun (the summer solstice, etc.),
and all in all the evidence deduced from these observatories
is in complete agreement with the correlation
of the Mayan and Christian time counts originally
effected on the evidence in sixteenth century
documents.</p>
<h3>The True Year.</h3>
<p>The base line at Copan yielded
accurate data on the exact length of the tropical
year, a period varying by a difficult fraction from
365 full days. The tropical year is the time measured
by the revolution of the earth around the sun
and by the recurring seasons. No agricultural people
could neglect this natural time period with its
obvious relation to planting and harvest.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the notational
360 day year (tun) of the Mayas and to their
formal calendar year (haab) of exactly 365 days.
The calendar year kept running ahead of the true
year by the accumulating amount of the days which
we intercalate on leap years but the Mayas wisely
made no such intercalations since to have done so
would have thrown their day count out of gear with
the moon and other planets and the somewhat defective
calendar based upon these minor heavenly
bodies. Therefore the months of the Mayan year
like those of the ancient Egyptian year slowly
moved through the seasons. But the Mayas calculated
an almost exact correction for the excess of
the true year over the vague 365 day year. This
excess amounts to about .24 of a day and their correction
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
seems to have been one day in four years
for short periods while for long periods they made
29 calendar rounds (1508 calendar years or 550,420
days) equal 1507 tropical years. This is a remarkably
accurate adjustment, much closer, in fact, than
that of our present Gregorian calendar. This great
cycle is comparable to the 1460 year Sothic cycle of
the Egyptians in so far as that relates to the flooding
of the Nile, but the Egyptian arrangement has
an error of about twelve days for the cycle while
the Mayan arrangement is accurate to a very small
fraction of a day.</p>
<p>In the calendars of various Guatemalan and Mexican
tribes the slow shifting of the months is attested
by actual statements of early Spanish writers.
But the conventional 365 day year was, after
all, sufficiently accurate for most purposes since
associations between the months and the seasons
would hold reasonably true for the average lifetime.</p>
<h3>The Lunar Calendar.</h3>
<p>The apparent revolution
of the moon around the earth was taken by the
Mayas as the basis of a lunar calendar distinct from
the civil calendar, but used in combination with it
for various ceremonial purposes. Now the average
duration of a lunar revolution is 29 days, 12 hours,
44 minutes, 2.87 seconds. Twelve lunations amount
to a little more than 354 days and are therefore
far short of a true year. Primitive peoples whose
principal interest is to keep the moon in adjustment
with the seasons have an occasional thirteenth
month in their luni-solar calendars.</p>
<p>The Metonic cycle of the Greeks, an equation of
19 tropical years, 235 lunations and 6940 days, has
been regarded as a remarkable achievement in observation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
The Mayas discovered the same equation
and with their system of designating days were
able to use it with much greater ease than the
Greeks since one katun minus one tzolkin gives exactly
the required number of days:&mdash;</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="r">1. </td><td class="r">0. </td><td class="r">0. </td><td class="r">0 = </td><td class="r">7200 days</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r"> </td><td class="r"> </td><td class="r">13. </td><td class="r">0 = </td><td class="r">260 days</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r"> </td><td class="r">19. </td><td class="r">5. </td><td class="r">0 = </td><td class="r">6940 days</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This interval is used prominently in several calculations
at Copan and Quirigua.</p>
<p>On pages 51 to 58 of the Dresden Codex is found
a remarkable lunar calendar covering 405 lunations
or nearly 33 years. The lunar revolutions are arranged
in groups of five or six, the former calculated
at 148 days and the latter at 177 or 178 days.
These are the necessary intervals between eclipses.
The total amounts to 11,960 days which exactly contains
the tzolkin and therefore forms a cycle. It is a
remarkable fact that 405 lunar revolutions amount,
according to modern calculations, to 11,959.888 or
only O.112 of a day less than the Mayan lunar calendar.
Therefore this re-entering series can be
used nine times, or nearly 300 years, before an
error amounting to one whole day has accumulated.
There is also evidence that the Mayas used the
great cycle of 29 &times; 52 calendar years, or 1507 tropical
years, in connection with the moon and here the
error for 18,639 lunations is about .64 of a day.</p>
<p>The Supplementary Series in Long Count dates
is probably to be interpreted as the statement of
the day reached by the Initial Series in a lunar calendar
with an accumulated error; that is, the Mayas
had an uncorrected lunar count as well as an uncorrected
calendar year. Glyph C records a number
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
of complete lunations which is never in excess
of six; Glyph D gives the number of days in the
current lunation when these are 19 or less and Glyph
E, which has the basic value of 20, finishes the count
of a current lunation. There is some evidence that
the Mayan lunar calendar in the fifth century A. D.
had receded about four days from the true positions
of the moon, the count being made from the new or
conjunctional phase. When, however, a new or full
phase actually coincided with an important round
number in the day count special record of the fact
was made.</p>

<p>The lunar table in the Dresden Codex does not
apply precisely to records of the First Empire but
possibly may be adjusted to the times of the Second
Empire. The indications are, however, too complicated
to be examined in detail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h3>Venus Calendar.</h3>
<p>Mayan astronomers reached a
remarkable knowledge of the movements of the
planet Venus and evolved a Venus calendar based
essentially on the correspondence between 8 calendar
years of 365 days each and 5 apparent or synodical
revolutions of Venus of 584 days each. Venus
whirling on an inside orbit actually makes thirteen
revolutions around the sun in very nearly the same
time that the earth makes eight revolutions and
therefore passes between the earth and the sun five
times (the difference between 13 and 8) during the
course of this astronomical period of 2920 days.
Just before inferior conjunction the planet disappears
as evening star and a few days later emerges
as morning star. The mean length of the synodical
revolution of Venus is 583.92 days and the actual
length may vary about four days from this mean.
While the Mayas standardized the Earth year at
365 days and the Venus year at 584 days, they were
fully aware of the amount of error in each case, and
made proper correction for it without resorting to
the devices of intercalation or excision.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Mayas manipulated the
year and the lunation in combination with the
tzolkin or permutation of 20 days and 13 numbers.
They also found a round of these elements in combination
with the phases of Venus. Since the period
of 2920 days is divisible by 20 but not by 13
it had to be taken 13 times before the round of the
Venus calendar was reached.</p>
<p>In the Dresden Codex five pages are devoted to
this round of the Venus calendar. Each Venus
year of 584 days is divided into four parts of 236
days for the phase of morning star, 90 days (superior
conjunction), 250 days (evening star) and 8
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
days (inferior conjunction). These divisions agree
closely enough with actual appearance. But we
must remember that the observations were made
without instruments and that the planet cannot be
seen by the naked eye when close to the sun. Moreover
we must expect beliefs as to the nature of this
planet, personified as a god, to supplement the
knowledge gained from actual observations. The
obscuration of Venus at inferior conjunction seems
to have been greatly dreaded especially when a
round number in the day count fell within the eight
days of its duration. A grotesque two-headed
monster apparently ruled this fatal period: on the
front head is seen the symbol of Venus and on the
rear head the symbol of the sun, both associated
with elements of death.</p>
<p>The Venus calendar seems to have taken form in
the sixth century B. C. on the basis of heliacal risings
of the planet as morning star in sets of five
making an eight year cycle. The dates in the
Mayan calendar especially emphasized in connection
with Venus are 19 Xul, 18 Kayab, 12 Yax, 6 Zip,
and 5 Kankin standing exactly 584 days apart,
while the corresponding dates in the Gregorian calendar
are April 12, November 17, June 24, January
29, and September 5. When these sets of dates,
one in a fixed and the other in a vague calendar are
carried back to a common focus they are found to
correspond very closely with the proper astronomical
phase of Venus. The maximum difference of
the true positions of Venus from the positions in
the Venus calendar is then only two days, plus or
minus.</p>
<p>The coincidences of the 8 day period of obscuration
of Venus at inferior conjunction with the following
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
round numbers in the day count was memorialized
by important monuments:&mdash;</p>
<table class="center" summary="">

</table>
<p>The Venus table in the Dresden Codex, the introductory
page of which has been explained in an
earlier section (see <a href="#plXXIV">Plate XXIV</a>) emphasizes the
same Mayan and Gregorian positions of Venus as
the ancient monuments but this table was evidently
intended to be used between the Tenth and Thirteenth
centuries A. D. The point of departure for
the table is 9.9.9.16.0, 1 Ahau 18 Kayab, April 12, 363
A. D., which does not coincide with an heliacal rising
of the planet, although April 12 and 18 Kayab occur
in other connections at the time of the inauguration
of the Venus calendar in the Sixth century B. C.
But in the Lunar table we find 10.19.6.1.0, 4 Ahau 18
Kayab, November 20, 950, which does reach an heliacal
rising of Venus as morning star.</p>
<h3>Summary of Mayan History.</h3>
<p>A brief summary
of Mayan history is given below:&mdash;</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Protohistoric Period</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">613 B. C. to 176 A. D. <span class="hst">7.0.0.0.0 to 9.0.0.0.0</span></p>
</div>
<p>The counting of days apparently began on August
6, 613 B. C. and the civil calendar in perfected form
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
was inaugurated about 580 B. C. when 0 Pop coincided
with the winter solstice, while the Venus
calendar emerged half a century later. The calendarial
inventions, the numerical notation and the
hieroglyphic system may, perhaps, be credited to
the genius of one man afterwards deified as Itzamna.
The earliest contemporary Mayan date
occurs on a jade statuette from San Andres Tuxtla,
and is May 16, 98 B. C. The next earliest one is on
the jade tablet known as the Leyden Plate and is
November 17, 60 A. D., having reference to the Venus
calendar. This is followed almost immediately
by several contemporary dates on monuments at
Uaxactun which also are of astronomical import.
The design on the Leyden Plate shows that the characteristic
details of Mayan drawing had already
been developed and we may surmise that during the
protohistoric period the early carvings were on
wood instead of stone and that the peculiar religion
of the Mayas was even then beginning to crystallize
around the serpent, the jaguar, etc.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Early Period</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">176 A. D. to 373 A. D. <span class="hst">9.0.0.0.0 to 9.10.0.0.0</span></p>
</div>
<p>During these ten katuns the great cities of the
south make rapid strides towards grandeur. Pyramidal
mounds are erected and temples built upon
them. Public squares are laid out and in these are
set up stel&aelig; and altars. The leading early cities
are Palenque, Tikal, and Copan, where the dated
monuments and temples mark rapid progress in the
arts of sculpture and architecture while the subject
matter of inscriptions reveals growing ability in
astronomy and mathematics. Low angular relief
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
characterizes stone sculptures and the profile presentation
of the human figure is now handled more
skilfully than front view.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Middle Period</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">373 A. D. to 471 A. D. <span class="hst">9.10.0.0.0 to 9.15.0.0.0</span></p>
</div>
<p>Some of the most beautiful monuments of the
Mayas belong to this middle period. While archaism
does not entirely disappear there is freshness,
purity of style, and straightforwardness of presentation
about the sculpture of this age. Flamboyancy
is not apparent. At Copan the Great Mound
was practically carried to completion during this
period, an enormous undertaking which absorbed
so much energy that few stel&aelig; were set up. The
best series of monuments from the middle period
are seen at Naranjo and Piedras Negras.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Great Period</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">471 A. D. to 629 A. D. <span class="hst">9.15.0.0.0 to 10.3.0.0.0</span></p>
</div>
<p>Many cities flourished in the culminating years of
Mayan civilization. In addition to those already
mentioned Quirigua, Ixkun, Seibal, Nakum, Cancuen,
Yaxchilan, Tonin&aacute;, and Kob&aacute; were important
centers while a complete list of the sites with dated
monuments would show many more names. The
territorial extension reaches from northern Yucatan
to the Guatemalan highlands and from southern
Vera Cruz to central Honduras. Art passes
through interesting changes with tendencies towards
flamboyancy. Architecture makes great advances:
rooms become wider, walls thinner and
forms more refined and pleasing. The calculations
deal more and more with complicated astronomical
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
subjects and dates belong less and less in the category
of contemporary history. The first age of
Mayan civilization, called the First Empire, comes
to an end with Katun 3 of Cycle 10, a date registered
at Uaxactun which, strangely enough, also boasts
the earliest stela with a contemporary date. It is
indicated that Uaxactun was occupied for 561 years
while the range of dates at Tikal is 394 years.
Abandonment of all the sites of the First Empire
took place within something like fifty years. What
caused this collapse? Civil war? Social decadence?
Failure of food supply? Or perhaps some
overwhelming epidemic? There is good reason for
believing that the sudden appearance of yellow
fever may have had a part in the catastrophe. References
in the Chronicles to the First Empire are
very brief and do not help us find the answer to
this mystery.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Transition Period</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">629 A. D. to 964 A. D. <span class="hst">10.3.0.0.0 to 11.0.0.0.0</span></p>
</div>
<p>Most of the Mayas surviving the collapse of the
First Empire seem to have found a second home in
western Yucatan, especially in the region called
Chakunputun in the Chronicles. Here the rainfall
is much less and the forest environment not nearly
so luxuriant. Certain cities, which probably date
from this transitional period, such as Hochob, Dzibilnocac,
Rio Bec, etc., have very beautiful architecture
showing advances over that of the First Empire
in some features. Dated documents are so
rare as practically to be non-existent. It seems
probable that Mayan learning had been reduced to
books for there is ample evidence from the succeeding
period that astronomical and calendarial knowledge
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
had been conserved from ancient times. At
the end of these lean centuries, the Mayas made
their way still farther north. Chichen Itza which
had been a provincial city of the First Empire was
reoccupied and the Mayan renaissance known as the
Second Empire began.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Period of the League of Mayapan</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">964 A. D. to 1191 A. D. <span class="hst">11.0.0.0.0 to 11.11.10.0.0</span></p>
</div>
<p>The first phase of the Mayan renaissance was
pretty clearly centered in Chichen Itza although
the earliest date which may be contemporary is
probably that of the Temple of the Initial Series at
Holactun. The inscription shows a survival of the
ancient method of counting time and is now believed
to treat of the interval between March 9, 1012 A. D.
and November 14, 1016 A. D. Other cities rising to
splendor during the Second Empire are Kabah,
Labna, Sayil, and Izamal. The time of foundation
for Uxmal is rather difficult to determine. According
to tradition it was the capital of Toltec immigrants
into Yucatan, but when or how they arrived
cannot be answered definitely. The League of
Mayapan was organized as an alliance between
Chichen Itza and Uxmal in the second half of the
twelfth century, and Mayapan was built as a neutralized
capital of church and state under the inspiration
of a Toltec noble named Quetzalcoatl. Finally,
Izamal and Chichen Itza rebelled and Inetzalcoatl
conquered the latter city in 1191 and made it
the capital of a Maya-Toltec state.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Period of Mexican Influence</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1191 A. D. to 1437 A. D. <span class="hst">11.11.10.0.0 to 12.4.0.0.0</span></p>
</div>
<p>The helpers of Hunac Ceel bore Mexican names
and belonged to the Toltec nation. Hunac Ceel is
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
identified in one place with Kukulcan, the name
meaning &ldquo;plumed serpent&rdquo; in the Mayan language,
and in another place with Quetzalcoatl which has the
same significance in the Mexican language. In
Chichen Itza sculptural art and architecture have
many clear analogies to works in the Valley of Mexico.
The building called the Castillo seems to have
been built by Quetzalcoatl, being the first structure
in which serpent columns and other structural ideas
of this ruler were given expression. The Temple
of the High Priest&rsquo;s Grave is a developed example
of the new style bearing the date December 31, 1339
A. D. The elaborate Group of the Columns with
the famous Temple of the Warriors, may be still
later.</p>
<p>In the first half of the fifteenth century civil war
and epidemic disease brought about a second depopulation
of the stone-built cities including Chichen
Itza, Mayapan, Uxmal, and probably also numerous
other sites in the region of Uxmal. The last monument
at Mayapan may declare the date September
28, 1437.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Modern Period</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1437 A. D. to the present day.</p>
</div>
<p>After the second general abandonment of urban
life the Mayas seem to have been divided into many
warring factions. Temples were still regarded as
sacred and some constructions in stone and mortar
were still made, as we know from the first Spanish
descriptions of towns on the east coast of Yucatan.
Tulum probably represented this last phase and
this site on a cliff overlooking the Caribbean is probably
the city compared to Seville by the coasting

Tulum is believed to record the last setting up of
a katun stone by the Mayas on 12.8.0.0.0, 2 Ahau 3
Pop, August 5, 1516, almost exactly 2129 years after
the Mayas began to count every day in order.</p>
<p>At the present time certain ancient ideas still persist
among the Lacandone Indians of the lowlands
and among the Quich&eacute;, Cakchiquels, and several
other tribes of the highlands. But the old glory of
the Mayan civilizations has passed away never to
return. A prophetic vision of this end is found in
one of the Mayan Books of Chilam Balam which
relates to events immediately after the founding of
Merida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was then that the teaching of Christianity
began, that shall be universal over our land. Then
began the construction of the church here in the
center of the town of Tihoo: great labor was the
destiny of the katun. Then began the execution by
hanging, and the fire at the ends of our hands.
Then also came ropes and cords into the world.
Then the children of the younger brothers (the Indians)
passed under the hardship of legal summons
and tribute. Tribute was introduced on a large
scale and Christianity was introduced on a large
scale. Then the seven sacraments of the word of
God were established. Let us receive our guests
heartily: our elder brothers (the white men) come!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c5">Chapter III
<br />THE MIDDLE CIVILIZATIONS</h2>
<p>The influence of the Mayan civilization when at
its height (400 to 600 A. D.) may be traced far
beyond the limits of the Mayan area. Ideas
in art, religion, and government that were then
spread broadcast served to quicken nations of diverse
speech and a series of divergent cultures resulted.
Most of these lesser civilizations were at
their best long after the great Mayan civilization
had declined, but one or two were possibly contemporary.
It will be the aim in the present chapter
to emphasize the indebtedness of these lesser civilizations
to the Mayas as well as to comment upon
their individual characters.</p>
<p>We will first proceed northwest into Mexico and
then southeast into the Isthmus of Panama. The
environment under which the Mayas developed their
arts of life continues in narrowing bands westward
along the Gulf of Mexico and southward across the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The most westerly Mayan
city of importance seems to have been Comalcalco.
But there is also a large ruin near San
Andres Tuxtla and it may be significant that the
earliest dated object of the Mayas (the Tuxtla
Statuette) came from this region. In other words,
the cradle of Mayan culture may have been in this
coastal belt where arid and humid conditions exist
side by side and where the figurines of the archaic
type are found together with those of the Mayas.
Unfortunately, the arch&aelig;ology of this part of Mexico
has been little studied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<h3>The Olmeca or Rubber People.</h3>
<p>The Olmeca may
be placed in the humid region of southern Vera Cruz
and western Tabasco which the Aztecs of later times
called Nonoalco. This region is frequently mentioned
in the most ancient of the Mexican traditions,
doubtless symbolizing in a general way the civilizing
contacts with the Mayas. Rubber is called <i>olli</i>
in the Mexican language and while the earliest
known specimens of rubber are those found in the
Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza, the ceremonial and
practical uses of the material are mostly mentioned
in connection with the Olmeca and Totonac peoples.
Rubber was used for incense, for water-proofing
purposes, to tip drumsticks, etc. A large rubber
ball was also used in a sacred game which may be
compared to basket ball since the goals were rings
set high up in the parallel walls of a specially constructed
court.</p>
<p>According to Ixtlilxochitl&rsquo;s history the Olmeca
came before the Toltecs and were the first to extend
their civilizing rule over parts of the Mexican highlands.
Some authorities think the Olmeca were a
Mayan tribe but it is quite possible that they
spoke Mexican. They may have fled south at the
breakdown of the Toltec empire for we find in Nicaragua
at the time of the Conquest a group of this
name with traditions pointing to the far north.
The ruins found in 1927 by the writer at Cerro de
las Mesas, west of Alvarado Lagoon, may possibly
be ascribed to this people. The site contains seventeen
monuments, several of which are dedicated to
Quetzalcoatl and must be referred to the thirteenth
century. Bars and dots are used in connection with
day signs to record dates which may belong to the
calendarial system appearing on Zapotecan monuments.</p>

<h3>Zapotecan Culture.</h3>
<p>In the State of Oaxaca the
Zapotecan Indians attained to a high degree of civilization,
but a study of their culture shows they
were profoundly indebted to the Mayas for many
ideas. Monte Alban, the White Mountain, overlooking
the modern City of Oaxaca is the principal
arch&aelig;ological site in point of size and may have
been the ancient capital. It was abandoned before
the coming of the Spaniards, however, and Mitla
appears to have taken its place.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 52. Comparison of Mayan and Zapotecan Serpent Heads.
The first two examples are from Palenque and the second two from
Monte Alban.</p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately no extensive traditions have come
down to us to help in the restoration of Zapotecan
history, or in that of the neighboring Mixtecs. Although
the art, hieroglyphic writing, and calendar
system were pretty clearly derived from the Mayas,
nevertheless there was time and opportunity for
these to develop interesting characters of their own.
It is impossible to tell from the record whether the
Zapotecs ever embarked on a career of empire: the
area in which the full complex of the characteristic
products occurs is practically limited to the area at
present occupied by the tribe. It is quite possible
that the Zapotecs were conquered by the Toltecs in
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
the twelfth century and that such similarities as
exist between the forms of Zapotecan sculptural art
and those of the Toltec cities of Xochicalco and Teotihuacan
in central Mexico, on the one hand, and
those of Pipil and Chorotegan sites in Guatemala
and Salvador, on the other hand, are to be explained
by intercommunications under the Toltec r&eacute;gime.</p>

</div>
<p>Monte Alban and Mitla stand in strong contrast
to each other, the first crowning a mountain ridge,
the second occupying a valley site. Monte Alban
has no buildings intact, but shows a vast assemblage
of enormous pyramids and platforms. Mitla has
only one small pyramid, but boasts a series of finely
preserved temples on low platform bases. In
Monte Alban we find monolithic monuments comparable
to the stel&aelig; of the Mayas, and carrying
hieroglyphic inscriptions: also pottery figurines
and jade amulets in a style which follows rather
closely the models developed in the early cities of
the humid lowlands. At Mitla there are none of
these things: instead, the architectural decoration
shows a most interesting use of textile designs
treated in a mosaic of cut stones. It is apparent
then that a long record of high culture is to be found
in the Zapotecan field.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>At Monte Alban there are one or two narrow
vaulted chambers in mounds, but on the tops of the
mounds the few excavations have disclosed only
simple cell-like rooms which probably had flat roofs.
Some hints of ancient architectural decoration can
be picked up here and there. Figures similar to
those modeled in bold relief on the fronts of the cylindrical
funeral urns (see <a href="#ill1">frontispiece</a>) seem to
have been used over doorways, somewhat after the
fashion of the Mayan mask panels.</p>
<p>The hieroglyphs that are found on the stel&aelig; of
Monte Alban and on stone slabs from other sites,
resemble the Mayan hieroglyphs in the use of bar
and dot numerals, but the day and month signs have
never been identified with either the Mayan or Aztecan
system, although almost certainly dealing with
the same type of calendar. Lintels with lines of
hieroglyphs on the outer edge have been found in
burial chambers at Cuilapa and Xoxo. The forms
at the former site are clearly and beautifully drawn,
while at the latter site they are degenerate and probably
merely decorative.</p>
<p>In Zapotecan funerary urns a close connection
with Mayan art can easily be demonstrated. The
urns are cylindrical vessels concealed behind elaborate
figures built up from moulded and modeled
pieces. Many of these built-up figures clearly represent
human beings while others represent grotesque
divinities or human beings wearing the
masks of divinities. The purely human types have
a formal modeling in high relief, the head usually
being out of proportion to the rest of the body.
The pose is ordinarily a seated one with the hands
resting on the knees or folded over the breast. Details
of dress are very clearly shown including
capes, girdles, aprons, or skirts and headdresses.
Necklaces are often worn with a crossbar pendant
to which shells are attached. Headdresses are
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
made of feathers and grotesque faces and are often
very elaborate. As for the divine types the jaguar
and a long-nosed reptile are the most common. The
latter has a human body and may possibly be an
adaptation of the Mayan Long-nosed God.</p>
<p>The funerary urns are found in burial mounds
called <i>mogotes</i> which contain cell-like burial chambers.
The urns are not found within these cells
but on the floor in front of them, in a niche over
the door, or even on the roof. They are frequently
encountered in groups of five and seem never to
contain offerings.</p>
<p>Other Zapotecan pottery is mostly made of the
same bluish clay used in the urns. This clay is
finely adapted to plastic treatment but never carries
painted designs. The pottery products include
pitchers of beautiful and unusual shapes, dishes
with tripod legs modeled into serpent heads, incense
burners, bowls, plates, etc. Of the same clay
are also made whistles in realistic forms, and
moulded figurines. Painted pottery also occurs in
forms and designs of rare beauty, but it is much
less characteristic of the Zapotecan province than
the unpainted ware.</p>
<p>Carved jades of splendid workmanship have been
recovered in the Zapotecan region and there is reason
to believe that this semi-precious stone was obtained
here in the natural state. Many of the pieces
are smoothed only on the front, while the back retains
its old weathered and stream-worn surface.
Beautiful examples of gold work found in this region
must be given a late date.</p>
<p>Splendid manuscripts were obtained by the Spaniards
in the Zapotecan region, but the pictures of
the gods as well as the hieroglyphs show strong
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
Aztecan influences. These
will be discussed briefly in
a later section. Some accounts
have been preserved
of the special features of
Zapotecan religion which
mark them off rather
sharply from the Aztecs,
however.</p>
<p>The high priests of the
Zapotecans were called
&ldquo;Seers&rdquo; and the ordinary
priests were &ldquo;Guardians
of the Gods&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sacrificers.&rdquo;
There was a sort
of priestly college where
the sons of chiefs were
trained in the service of
the gods. The religious
practices included incense
burning, sacrificing of
birds, and animals, and letting
of one&rsquo;s own blood by
piercing the tongue and the
ear. Human sacrifice was
made on stated occasions
and was attended by rites
of great solemnity. The
Zapotecs never went to the
blood excesses that stain
the annals of the Aztecs.</p>

<p>The 260 day cycle of the
time count, was subdivided
into four periods of 65
days and each period was
under control of a single god and was associated
with one of the cardinal points. Each period of
sixty-five days was further divided into five groups
of thirteen days for a ceremonial reason. Some
authorities have considered that the general form
of the Central American calendar originated in the
region of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and spread
to the north and to the south. But dependable history
in the Mayan area goes back much farther than
in the Zapotecan region and renders such a guess
extremely hazardous.</p>
<h3>Mitla.</h3>
<p>The famous temples of Mitla are the best-preserved
examples of architecture on the highlands
of Mexico and are peculiar in form and decoration.
The word Mitla is a corruption of the Aztecan word
<i>Mictlan</i>, place of the dead. This site was the burial
ground of Zapotecan kings and may have been a
place of pilgrimage. It was conquered by the Aztecs
in the last decade of the fifteenth century.
While the architecture belongs in a class by itself
the frescoes have the distinct character of the Aztecan
period.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 55. Wall Paintings of Mitla, resembling in style the Pictographic
Art of the Codices from Southern Mexico.</p>
</div>
<p>The remains at this site have already been contrasted
with those at Monte Alban. There is one
fairly large mound at Mitla but it has no surviving
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
superstructure. The temples are placed on low
platforms which usually contain cruciform tombs.
The buildings are carefully oriented and are assembled
in groups of four which almost enclose
square paved courts. The heavy walls have surfaces
of cut stone and a filling of concrete or rubble
and are ornamented with longitudinal panels of
geometric designs arranged according to a carefully
worked out plan. The geometric patterns are
based on textile art and the mosaics of separately
carved stones which fit neatly together preserve for
us the ancient designs on belts and mantles. The
chambers are long and narrow and formerly had
flat roofs which have completely vanished. The
wide doorways usually have two piers which help
to support the lintel blocks. These are carefully
trimmed stones of great length and weight. All
the outer surfaces of the Mitla temples were sized
with plaster and painted red and the frescoes, traces
of which can still be seen in several buildings, are
in red and black upon a white base. Various gods
and ceremonies are represented in these frescoes,
but only the upper portion of the bands can be made
out in detail.</p>
<p>Cruciform tombs are found under several of the
temples at Mitla as well as at a number of neighboring
sites such as Xaaga and Guiaroo. In these
tombs the designs in panels appear on the inside and
are carved directly on large blocks of stone. Pottery
remains are rare in the cruciform tombs of the
Mitla type but a few examples of gold work have
been discovered in them.</p>
<p>Within a short distance of Mitla is a fortified hill
with several heavy walls that still stand to the
height of perhaps twenty feet. In the flat valley
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
between this hill and the ruins a considerable number
of potsherds are plowed up in the field.</p>
<h3>Totonacan Culture.</h3>
<p>In the central part of the
state of Vera Cruz are found the remains commonly
referred to the Totonacan Indians. These Indians
are southern neighbors of the Huastecas who are
an outlying Mayan tribe. The Totonacan language
is according to some authorities thrown into the
Mayan stock. If not truly Mayan it contains many
loan words. This apparent connection in language
is all the more interesting in view of the character
of Totonacan art which also shows a strong strain
of Mayan feeling and technique in certain products
but an unmistakable likeness to the archaic art of
the Mexican highlands in certain other products.
The pottery faces in the archaic style are advanced
beyond the average of such work and probably represent
a late phase.</p>

we find the simple single or double groove eyes and
in other cases these eyes are made more conspicuous
by the use of black bituminous paint. The eyeball
is developed at the end of the series.</p>

<p class="pcap">Laughing Head of the Totonacs, remarkable example

served as decorative details on temple fronts.</p>
</div>
<p>The smiling or laughing faces have a much higher
technique and are perhaps the finest examples of
clay modeling from the New World. These heads
have tubular extensions at the back and were possibly
set into temple walls. The faces and foreheads
are broadened in accordance with the esthetic type
of a forehead flattening people. While the faces
vary so much in minor details as to create the impression
that they are portraits of actual persons
they are alike in method of modeling. Nearly all
are laughing or smiling in a very contagious fashion.
Sometimes the tip of the tongue is caught between
the teeth, sometimes the corners of the mouth are
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
pulled down as if the smile were reluctant, and there
are other individual variations in the expressions
of lively and unrestrained mirth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous objects found in Totonacan
territory are the so-called &ldquo;stone collars&rdquo; or
&ldquo;sacrificial yokes.&rdquo; In size and shape these resemble
horse collars, but in contrast to somewhat
similar objects from Porto Rico they are usually
open while the latter are closed. Nothing is really
known concerning their use but there has been no
lack of fanciful surmises. The most popular explanation
is that the yokes were placed over the
necks of victims about to be sacrificed. It is evident
that the yokes were intended to be placed in a horizontal
position because there is a plain lower surface
and the ends are frequently carved with faces
that are right side up only when the plain side is
down. These yokes represent the richest and most
elaborate works of art in the entire region since
they are carved in the most finished manner from
single blocks of exceedingly hard stone.</p>
<p>Other peculiarly shaped stones are found in the
Totonacan area and are carved according to the
same splendid technique. The &ldquo;paddle-shaped&rdquo;
stones have been found in considerable numbers and
their use, like that of the stone yokes, is absolutely
unknown. It is evident from the carving that they
were intended to be stood on end.</p>

<p>The designs on the sacrificial yokes and paddle
stones are largely reptilian, but there are examples
where the turkey, the coyote, as well as the human
motive are treated somewhat after the manner of
the Mayas. Plumed serpents, monkeys, centipedes,
and crocodiles are interestingly drawn on pottery.
An important site is Papantla where a remarkably
ornate pyramid rising in six terraces may be seen,
as well as massive sculptures in the same style as
the works of art described above. The front wall
of each terrace on all four sides of the pyramid,
except for the space occupied by the stairway, is
divided into a series of niches neatly made of cut
stone. Formerly each of these niches may have
served to shelter the statue of some god. Many
fine remains of Totonacan art have been recovered
from the Island of Sacrifices in the harbor of Vera
Cruz. This island retained its ancient sacrificial
character in the time of the Spanish conquerors.
It is apparent, however, that the culture had already
changed greatly if we may judge by the ruins of
Cempoalan, the Totonacan capital in the sixteenth
century. The art of this city is largely Aztecan.</p>
<h3>The Toltecs.</h3>
<p>Mexican history is greatly concerned
with the Toltecs, the name meaning People
of Tula, or Tollan, &ldquo;place of the reeds.&rdquo; Evidence
is accumulating that this Tula was not the comparatively
insignificant ruin on the northern edge
of the Valley of Mexico, but instead was the great
city of San Juan Teotihuacan. The lesser Tula
may have been founded about 1200 A. D., just before
the collapse of Toltec power.</p>
<p>Arch&aelig;ology tells a more detailed and convincing
story of the Toltecs than does recorded history. In
the stratified remains at Atzcapotzalco, the objects
accredited to the Toltecs overlie those of the first
potters of the Archaic Period and are in striking
contrast to them. The principal motives of Toltec
decorative art are obviously related to the earlier
more brilliant work of the Mayas. The pyramids
of the Toltecs exceed in size those of the Mayas but
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
are of inferior construction, adobe bricks with concrete
facing taking the place of rubble and cut stone.
The temples that crowned these pyramids were also
of less solid construction and no single example is
now intact. Vaulted ceilings were replaced by flat
timbered ceilings or high pitched roofs of thatch.
Sometimes in wide rooms columns were used as additional
support for roof beams. The groundplans
of buildings other than temples show small rooms
arranged in an irregular fashion round courts.</p>
<p>The ceremonial game of <i>tlachtli</i> resembling basket
ball was an important feature of Toltec religion. It
may have been obtained from the Olmeca, but at any
rate spread far and wide under the Toltec r&eacute;gime.
Another feature of Toltec religion was the worship
of the sun&rsquo;s disk which is reflected in various sculptures.
Also this people are supposed to have invented
<i>pulque</i>, made from the fermented sap of the
agave. The reclining type of sculpture known as
Chacmool, after the famous example found at
Chichen Itza in northern Yucatan, may be a relic
of a peculiar Toltec cult in which drunkenness figured.
Human sacrifice was another feature of the
religion of the Mexican highlands in contrast to
that of the lowland Mayas. On the economic side
Toltec culture rested on the earlier Archaic civilization,
but on the artistic and ceremonial side it was
largely inspired by the Mayas through the mediation
of the Zapotecs, Olmecs, and Totonacs, but with
new emphasis on certain aspects and several important
innovations. The language of the Toltecs
seems to have been essentially the same as that of
the Aztecs who succeeded them.</p>
<p>The Toltecs made a radical departure in social
policy in that they took to war and expropriation as
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
a means of building up national wealth, thereby
paralleling, somewhat ineffectively to be sure, the
political methods of Europe and Western Asia.
There had been war before their time in Central
America, but not apparently for aggrandizement.
The Mayas, and most other Mexican and Central
American nations, developed excess food supply
which released many persons for the pursuit of
art and science. Perhaps it was pressure of population
upon food supply in an arid land that directed
the Toltecs towards tribute taking. At least the
fact is reasonably clear that this people did embark
upon a short-lived career of conquest and that they
levied tribute of precious stones and precious metals
and secured by the same means an augmented food
supply.</p>
<p>There is confusion and reduplication in the lists
of Toltec rulers and only three great names in succession
can be regarded as certain. These are
Huetzin, Ihuitimal, and Quetzalcoatl, although it
seems probable that there was a still earlier chieftain
named Mixcoatl or Mixcoamazatl and that two
successors of Quetzalcoatl were Matlaxochitl and
Nauyotl, the last-named also figuring as the first
lord of Colhuacan. Then follow various dynastic
lists for several Mexican tribes which flourished between
the downfall of the Toltecs and the coming of
the Spaniards.</p>
<h3>Quetzalcoatl and the Toltec Era.</h3>
<p>The chronology
of the Toltecs and their successors is greatly dilated
in several historical compilations made after the
Spanish conquest by intelligent natives who interpreted
fragments of ancient pictographic year
counts then surviving in Mexico. Thanks to a modern
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
survey of materials much more extensive than
those which Chimalpahin, Ixtlilxochitl, etc., had at
their disposal, we are now able to avoid the errors
of these writers.</p>
<p>In the original pre-Spanish chronicles important
events are recorded in connection with fifty-two
year signs falling in regular order and then repeating.
In the well-intentioned attempts to restore
Mexican history entire cycles are interpolated in
several places and the rulers are given lives of impossible
length. In the case of Ixtlilxochitl we possess,
fortunately, the principal documents which
this descendant of the Texcocan kings attempted to
interpret. Also in the case of the Annals of Quauhtitlan,
an early compilation made by a nameless
student of ancient history, we are in position to
adjudicate wide errors in chronology. There is an
annotation on this manuscript reading &ldquo;6 times 4
centuries, plus 1 century, plus 13 years, today the
22nd of May 1558.&rdquo; The &ldquo;centuries&rdquo; are the native
cycles of fifty-two years and the total on this
basis would amount to 1313 years. Subtracted
from 1558 the beginning would be found in 245
A. D., while the years set down by the compiler in
an unbroken series reach back to 635 A. D. But
there is no pre-Spanish support for written history,
outside the Mayan area, of anything like this antiquity.</p>
<p>The Toltec Era was established by Quetzalcoatl,
after a simplified model of the Mayan calendar, on
August 6, 1168 A. D., this date corresponding to a
day 1 Tecpatl (1 Flint) in the first position of a
month Toxcatl. This day gave its name to the entire
year and its hieroglyph was one of a series of
fifty-two used to designate years in the pictographic
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
records. Most of the Mexican year counts begin
with the particular sign 1 Tecpatl which corresponds
to 1168-69 A. D. In others there is reference to a
day 7 Acatl 1 Panquetzaliztli in a year 2 Acatl (February
16, 1195 A. D.) upon which a new fire ceremony,
established by Quetzalcoatl in accordance
with Mayan usage, was celebrated at intervals of
fifty-two years.</p>
<p>The conclusions are supported by evidence in
Guatemalan chronicles and also in records of the
Mayas for we have already seen that Quetzalcoatl
conquered Chichen Itza in 1191 A. D. The three
great Toltec emperors, Huetzin, Ihuitimal, and
Quetzalcoatl, swept over an area extending from
Durango to Nicaragua, the three seats of their government
being Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico,
Chichen Itza in Yucatan, and Iximch&eacute; in Guatemala.</p>
<p>Quetzalcoatl probably spent his youth in Yucatan,
returning to his highland home with strange religious
and social ideas. His opposition to the Toltec
idea of human sacrifice was followed by a war of
cults. Quetzalcoatl began the construction at Tula
with serpent columns like those of his lofty temple
in Chichen Itza. Also he appears to have founded
Cholula as a special center for his humane religion.
His death occurred in connection with a prognostication
in the Venus calendar of the Mayas, for the
year 1 Acatl, 1207-08 A. D.</p>
<p>Quetzalcoatl, perhaps the most remarkable figure
in ancient American history, was emperor, artist,
scientist, and humanist philosopher. He established
orders of knighthood as well as the coronation
ceremony used by the later Mexican kings. He
developed the various industrial arts and built up
a wide trade in cotton, cacao, and other products.
As a patron of the peripatetic merchant he appears
under the name Nacxitl, which means Four-way
Foot. Apotheosis being an idea strongly fixed
among the Toltecs, Quetzalcoatl was deified as Ehecatl,
God of Winds, on account of his support of the
Mayan god of rainstorms, and for his astronomical
work he was further deified as God of the Planet
Venus.</p>

<h3>San Juan Teotihuacan.</h3>
<p>This name Teotihuacan
means Where the Gods (i.e., the deified dead) Dwell.
This enormous ruin is located on the eastern margin
of the Valley of Mexico. The principal features of
Teotihuacan are two great pyramids and a straight
roadway lined with small pyramids. There are
also several groups of buildings of which the lower
walls and the bases of the piers are still to be seen
as well as some interesting fragments of fresco
painting. The smaller of the two great pyramids is
called the Pyramid of the Moon. It is located at
the end of the roadway which is commonly called
the Pathway of the Dead. The Pyramid of the
Sun is situated on the east side of the roadway.
This pyramid is about 180 feet in height and rises
in four sloping terraces. The temple which formerly
crowned its summit has entirely disappeared.
Explorations conducted by the Mexican government
showed that this pyramid was enlarged from time
to time and old stairways buried under new masonry.
On the south side of the small stream that
flows through the ruins is a group of buildings
called the Citadel.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>In 1921 the Mexican Government undertook a
restoration of the Citadel, following the discovery
of remarkable sculptures on the principal pyramid.
It appears that in ancient times this pyramid was
enlarged by an addition to one side and the richly
ornamented terraces and stairway buried (<a href="#plXXXIII">Plate XXXIII</a>).
The sculptured stones from the other
three sides of the temple were allowed to fall into
neglect by the Toltecs or were carried away and
put to other uses, but the portion buried was kept
in its original state. The colors are still bright in
many places and the great heads of plumed serpents
and obsidian butterflies sometimes retain their inset
eyes of obsidian. The decoration is a repeated
motive. The head of the feathered serpent projects
outward from the terrace walls and from the balustrade
of the stairway, while the body is in low relief.
The tail of the serpent has a rattle, and the body is
covered with feathers. Shells are seen below the
serpent where the body arches and just in front of
the tail is a massive head with two rings on the
frontal. This doubtless represents the Obsidian
Butterfly, a divinity of great importance among the
Toltecs, which is represented unmistakably in frescoes
at Teotihuacan as well as on pottery. The Citadel
well deserves its name, since it is a great enclosure,
much like a fort, with buildings upon its
bulwarks, and with steep outer walls, which could
easily be defended.</p>
<p>A few large sculptures have been found at Teotihuacan.
But the site is chiefly remarkable for pottery
figurines and heads that are picked up by thousands.
The heads present such a marked variety
of facial contour and expression that it would seem
as if every race under the sun had served as models.
It is very likely that these heads formed part of
votive offerings, being attached to bodies made of
some perishable material. The heads were seldom
used to adorn pottery vessels, although many modern
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
and fraudulent vases are so adorned. Dolls
with head and torso in one piece and with movable
arms and legs made of separate pieces were known.
The face of Tlaloc, the Rain God, is fairly common
in Teotihuacan pottery but other deities have not
surely been identified. It is not improbable that
the God of Fire is personified as an old man with
wrinkled face, but somewhat less
likely that Xipe is represented in
the faces that look out through
the three holes of a mask. The
jaguar, the monkey, the owl, and
other animals are also modeled
with excellent fidelity. The
Mayan convention of the human
face in the open jaws of the serpent
is not unknown.</p>

</div>
<p>A number of beautiful vases
painted in soft greens, pinks, and
yellows have been recovered
at Teotihuacan. These colors
would not stand the kiln and
they were applied after the vessel
had been burned. According
to one method, the outside of the
vessel was covered with a fine
coating of plaster upon which
the design was painted exactly as in fresco. According
to a second method the effect of <i>cloisonn&eacute;</i>
was cleverly achieved. This technique is most characteristic
of the region northwest of the Valley of
Mexico and will be described later. Incised or engraved
designs are commonly met with on pottery
vessels at Teotihuacan. No inscriptions have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
found at this ruin, in spite of the many years of
exploration.</p>
<h3>Xochicalco.</h3>
<p>Let us now pass over in brief review
several ruins which belong to the Toltecan period.
Xochicalco, the House of the Flowers, is a large ruin
near Cuernavaca. The position seems to have been
chosen primarily for defense. The rounded ridge
that drops off into deep valleys on either side is laid
out in courts, terraces, and pyramids. Only one
building offers evidence of the sculptural skill of
the ancient habitants. It is a temple, standing upon
a rather low platform mound. The sides of the
platform mound are decorated with great plumed
serpents, seated human figures, hieroglyphs, etc.
Parts of the sculptures also remain on the low walls
of the temple itself which is now roofless. The
stone carving at Xochicalco resembles that of Monte
Alban especially as regards the hieroglyphs and is
probably of somewhat later date than Teotihuacan.
All in all the conclusion seems safe that writing was
unknown outside the Mayan area before Quetzalcoatl
devised ways and means.</p>
<h3>Tula.</h3>
<p>Building stone of good quality was available
at this site and in consequence sculptures are
plentiful. Particularly famous are the great sculptured
columns which represent feathered serpents
and gigantic human figures. The drums are mostly
mortised and the columns are crowned by true capitals.
These architectural features at Tula find
their closest counterpart at the Mayan city of
Chichen Itza in northern Yucatan. The <i>tlachtli</i> or
ball court occurs at Tula and the groundplans of
complicated &ldquo;palaces&rdquo; can also be made out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<h3>Cholula.</h3>
<p>The sacred city of Cholula, in the environs
at Puebla, is chiefly famous for its great
pyramid. This structure is more or less irregular
in shape but the base averages more than a thousand
feet on the side and the total height, now somewhat
reduced, was probably close to two hundred
feet above the plain. Compared with the Pyramid
of Cheops, it covers nearly twice as much ground
and has a much greater volume, but lacks of course,
in height. As already noted, the pyramids of the
New World are simply foundations for temples and
thus always have flat tops. The great mound of
Cholula is a solid mass of adobe bricks of uniform
size laid in adobe mortar. The pyramid was evidently
faced with a thick layer of cement of which
a few patches still remain. Two other large
mounds exist at Cholula. One of these has been
partially destroyed and now stands as a vertical
mass of adobe bricks while the other is overgrown
with brush and cactus.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Unlike the other Toltecan cities Cholula was still
inhabited and a place of religions importance when
Cortez arrived in Mexico. But the figurines and
pottery vessels that are found at this site belong
for the most part to an epoch earlier than that of
the Aztecs. Quetzalcoatl was the patron deity of
Cholula and in the decorative art the serpent is
finely conventionalized. A pottery shape frequently
met with at Cholula is the flat plate bearing
polychrome designs.</p>
<h3>The Frontier Cities of the Northwest.</h3>
<p>An important
culture area is located upon the northwestern
limits of the area of high culture in ancient Mexico.
The best known and most accessible ruin is La
Quemada, &ldquo;The Burned&rdquo; which is situated a day&rsquo;s
ride from the city of Zacatecas. This site was
found in a deserted and ruinous condition by the
Spaniards in 1535 and there is little doubt that it
had been abandoned several centuries previous.
La Quemada has been popularly associated with
Chicomoztoc, &ldquo;The Seven Caves,&rdquo; a place famous
in Aztecan mythology, but this association rests
upon no scientific basis. It is simply an unauthoritative
attempt to invest a forgotten city with a
legendary interest. Chicomoztoc, where the Aztecs
came out of the underworld might be compared with
our own Garden of Eden and its exact location is
just as much an eternal riddle. La Quemada is a
terraced hill resembling Monte Alban and Xochicalco.
The retaining walls of terraces and pyramids
as well as the walls of buildings are still well
preserved. These walls consist of slabs of stone
set in a mortar of red earth. Perhaps the most
noteworthy structure is a wide hall containing seven
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
columns built of slabs of stone in the same manner
as the walls. All in all the architectural types as
well as the observed contacts in art point to a late
epoch of the Toltecan period. Other ruins of the
same character as La Quemada occur at Chalchihuites
on the frontier of Durango and at Totoate,
etc., in northern Jalisco.</p>
<p>The most important artistic product from this
northwestern region is a peculiar kind of pottery
which might be described as cloisonn&eacute; or encaustic
ware. Examination shows that this pottery was
first burned in the usual way so that it acquired a
red or orange color. Then the surface was covered
with a layer of greenish or blackish pigment to
the depth of perhaps a sixteenth of an inch. A
large part of this surface layer was then carefully
cut away with a sharp blade in such a way that the
remaining portions outlined certain geometric and
realistic figures. The sunken spaces, from which
the material had just been removed, were then filled
in flush with red, yellow, white, and green pigments.
The designs on this class of pottery are thus mosaics
in which the different colors are separated by narrow
lines of a neutral tint. The geometric motives
show a marked use of the terrace, the fret, and the
scroll. The realistic subjects are presented in a
highly conventionalized manner and have few stylistic
similarities to the figures from the Valley of
Mexico. Representative collections of this ware
from Totoate, already referred to, and from Estanzuela,
a hacienda near Guadalajara, are on exhibition
in the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>Cloisonn&eacute; pottery of a somewhat different style
sometimes occurs at Toltecan sites in the Valley of
Mexico, such as Tula, Teotihuacan, and Atzcapotzalco,
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
but fresco pottery which resembles it at first
glance is more characteristic. It appears that the
cloisonn&eacute; process was taken over from the embellishment
of gourd dishes in connection with which
it still exists over a large part of Mexico and Central
America.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 60. The Turtle Motive as developed in Negative Painting
with Wax at Totoate, Jalisco.</p>
</div>
<p>Another common method of ceramic decoration
taken over was that of negative painting similar to
the process used with cloth in making batik designs.
This process still exists in Central America as regards
gourd dishes although discontinued on pottery.
Negative painting appears to be an ancient
process of exceedingly wide distribution. It is
especially common in Jalisco and Michoacan, the
Valley of Toluca, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama,
and Colombia, and sometimes occurs in Yucatan and
Peru. The design was painted in wax or some
other soluble or combustible paint, then the entire
surface was covered with a permanent paint.
When the pot was burned the design came out in
the natural color of the clay against a black, or
sometimes a red field. The design was often made
two layers deep by applying simple masses of red
over the sizing before the impermanent paint of the
design proper was put on. In the northwestern
region of central Mexico now under consideration
the negative painting technique is associated with
conventionalized designs representing turtles (<a href="#fig60">Fig. 60</a>).
Another ware with designs in white is concerned
with derivatives
of the turtle
motive. Then there
are the remarkable
copper bells in the
form of turtles made
by coiling, that have
been found in nearby
Michoacan.</p>

<p>It is difficult to
place time limits for
the artistic styles
that once existed in
this northwestern region.
The archaic
culture seems to
have lasted longer
here than farther
south; next followed the northern flow of Toltecan
culture which later receded and finally came a rather
thin layer of Chichimecan or Aztecan culture. We
may tentatively conclude that the forgotten cities of
the Zacatecan subculture flourished after 1000 A. D.
The question should be settled because of its connection
with the dating of Pueblo ruins farther north.</p>
<h3>Santa Lucia Cozumalhualpa.</h3>
<p>The zonal distribution
of rain forests in southern Mexico and Central
America is especially important, as has been pointed
out, in connection with the spread of Mayan-type
civilizations. The Olmeca and Totonacs who were
among the first to feel the cultural effects of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
Mayan ascendency occupied lands of heavy precipitation.
The Zapotecan and Mixtecan areas were
partly wet and partly dry. The Toltecs seem originally
to have been desert dwellers but they extended
their conquests over tribes living in the humid
tropics and made much of cacao, rubber, copal,
etc., obtained by trade and tribute from such subject
peoples.</p>
<p>Along the Pacific coast below the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
lies a rain belt containing ruined cities
which flourished between 1000 to 1300 A. D., or on
the historical level of the Toltec expansion. The
sculptural art at these sites resembles the works
attributed to the Olmecs in Tabasco and Vera Cruz
on the one hand and to the works of the Chorotega of
lower Central America on the other. One such ruin
is Quiengola near the modern city of Tehuantepec,
another occupies a ridge above Tonal&aacute; and there is
a cluster of sites in the environs of Santa Lucia
Cozumalhualpa in southern Guatemala, extending
into western Salvador.</p>
<p>Whether or not the sculptures of Santa Lucia
Cozumalhualpa are to be credited to the Pipil, a
Mexican tribe, is far from certain, but human sacrifice
and other Toltec religious ideas are plainly
presented. We find here elaborate speech scrolls
comparable to those of Xochicalco and the Toltec
work at Chichen Itza. Also there is evidence of
the ceremonial importance of cacao in this region,
the god of this economic plant being pictured in
the form of a jaguar.</p>
<p>A peculiar type of pottery centered in southern
Guatemala and western Salvador from which region
it was distributed far and wide by trade. Although
a few examples of this ware are found at Copan it
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
is clear from the designs that most of the pieces belong
to a time subsequent to the abandonment of
this Mayan city. The ware has a semi-glaze which
is the result of lead in the clay. Because paint
could not be applied to this ware, the esthetic idea
of shape was allowed to develop itself without
hindrance. This pottery is now referred to as
plumbate ware.</p>
<h3>The Chorotegan Culture.</h3>
<p>Passing south and east
from the Mayan area we find remains of a rich and
in many ways peculiar art, consisting mostly of pottery
and stone carvings, to which the name Chorotegan
is applied. This name means Driven-out People.
It was first used in connection with several
tribes of the Chiapanec-Otomi stock dispossessed of
a fertile area about Lake Nicaragua by the intrusive
Mexican-speaking Nicarao. The Chorotega
were not, however, totally dispossessed since they
continued to hold the Peninsula of Nicoya in Costa
Rica as well as other pieces of territory. In an
arch&aelig;ological sense the name Chorotegan fittingly
can be extended to eastern parts of Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, and Honduras, since the inhabitants of
this stretch of land were also dispossessed some
time before the coming of the Spaniards. Or perhaps
they voluntarily migrated northward towards
the end of the Toltec rule and are to be identified
with the Otomi, Tlappaneca, and Mazateca of southern
and central Mexico. The Tlappaneca and
Otomi are definitely associated with introduction
into Mexico of the peculiar cult of Xipe, God of the
Flayed. This cult was clearly of southern origin
and indeed still survived at Nicaragua at the time
of the Spanish Conquest. The Mazateca were
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
found in transit by Cortez, in the southern part of
the Peninsula of Yucatan, living in palisaded villages.
Similar palisaded villages once flourished
in Honduras. The wild South American tribes who
replaced the eastern Chorotega exhibit a cultural
non-conformity with the arch&aelig;ological remains of
the region they now occupy.</p>

great changes and have become highly conventionalized.</p>
</div>
<p>Close analysis shows that many of the decorative
motives in Chorotegan art were developed from
those of the Mayas. The serpent and the monkey
furnish the majority of the designs that are surely
Mayan but each of these is carried so far away from
the original that only an expert can see the connections.
The arms and legs of the monkeys are
lengthened and given an extra number of joints
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
while the heads degenerate into circles. The
tongues of the serpents are elongated and bent
downward at the end. All the open spaces are
treated with scallops or fringes of short lines.</p>

<p>There is also in Chorotegan art a crocodilian
motive that may be peculiar to the Isthmian region
although it has Mayan affinities. The jaguar is also
important in this ancient art. Among the most
interesting vases are those that have a modeled
head projecting from one side (jaguar, monkey, or
bird) and two of the three legs of the vessel modified
into animal legs. On these elaborate vessels there
are bands of painted decoration mostly concerned
with the crocodile.</p>

<p>The extremely elaborate metates (stones upon
which maize was ground) from southern Nicaragua
and northern Costa Rica probably were made by the
producers of the peculiar pottery art already described.
These were carved out of solid blocks of
lava with stone tools. It is not unlikely that these
elaborate metates were used as ceremonial seats
since few of them show signs of use. The jaguar
is perhaps the most common motive used in the
decoration of these metates. The back is broad
and slightly dished, the head projects from the center
of one end and the tail swings in a curve from
the other end to one of the feet.</p>

<p>We may be reasonably sure that the stone slabs
date from a fairly late epoch because an undoubted
&ldquo;Chacmool&rdquo; exhibiting the same style of carving
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
has been discovered here. The &ldquo;Chacmool,&rdquo; a half
reclining figure with the knees drawn up, the body
supported in part upon the elbows and a bowl for
incense or other offerings in the pit of the stomach,
gets its fanciful name from Le Plongeon who discovered
the original at Chichen Itza. But the unmistakable
sculptures of this type were apparently
developed by the highland tribes and the cult was
introduced into northern Yucatan during the period
of Mexican influence. In addition to Chichen Itza
examples have been found at Cempoalan, the historic
Totonacan capital near Vera Cruz, at Texcoco,
in the Valley of Mexico, at Jhuatzio in the Tarascan
region, as well as at Chalchuapa far to the southeast
in Salvador. All of these occurrences indicate a
late Toltecan horizon for its distribution.</p>
<h3>Isthmian Gold Work.</h3>
<p>Metal-working was unknown
to the Mayas of the First Empire, but is
abundantly illustrated in cities of the Second Empire,
especially Chichen Itza where the pieces are
predominantly of Costa Rican and Colombian manufacture
evidently secured in trade. We are therefore
justified in concluding that the splendid Isthmian
gold work came into being after 630 A. D. and
was typically developed by 1200 A. D. The &ldquo;wire
technique,&rdquo; essentially a cast rather than a soldered
filigree, characterized metal working as far south
as southern Colombia and is also the dominant mode
in Mexico. In addition to plain and hollow casting,
two kinds of gold plating were carried to perfection
by the ancient metal workers: one a heavy plating
over copper and the other a thin gilding. The manner
in which this plating was done is still uncertain.
It has been suggested that the molds were lined with
leaf gold or sprinkled with gold dust before the
baser copper was poured in. Also acids are said
to have been used to dissolve out copper from the
surfaces. Many ornaments are of pure beaten gold
and have designs in <i>repouss&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>The gold objects are found in stone box graves
along with pottery and stone carvings. Gold is
taken from only a small percentage of the graves,
probably those of chiefs. A systematic rifling of
the ancient cemeteries has been going on since the
arrival of the Spaniards, but the finds have mostly
been thrown into the melting pot. The burial
places are sometimes marked by low platforms built
over a group of graves. An iron rod, giving forth
a hollow sound when the stone cysts are struck, is
used by the searchers. Human bones are found in
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
these graves, but seldom in a state of good preservation.</p>
<p>Mr. Minor C. Keith&rsquo;s collection of gold work
from Costa Rica and Panama is unexcelled and
illustrates the range of technical processes as well
as of ornamental forms. Human forms are represented
with peculiar headdresses and with various
objects carried in the hands and often they are
joined in pairs. Many of the most beautiful amulets
are frogs arranged either singly or in groups
of two or three. These figures are all provided
with a ring on the under side for suspension.
Lizards, turtles, and crocodiles are frequently modeled
as well as clam shells, crabs, and monkeys.
But perhaps the most frequent amulets are those
that picture birds with outspread wings among
which may be recognized vultures, harpy eagles,
gulls, man-of-war birds, and parrots. The larger
and more elaborate pieces of gold work cast considerable
light on the ancient religion of the natives
since beast gods are figured in half human form.
Bells of copper and gold were much used in gala
dress and were doubtless an object of trade with
the tribes farther north.</p>

<br />THE AZTECS</h2>
<p>The Aztecs were the dominant nation on the
highlands of Mexico when Cortez marched
with his small army to conquer New Spain.
The horrible sacrifices that they made to their gods
and the wealth and barbaric splendor of their rulers
have often been described. But their history in
point of time covered short space and their art and
religion was based in a large measure on achievements
of the nations that had preceded them.</p>
<h3>Mayas and Aztecs compared to Greeks and Romans.</h3>
<p>A remarkably close analogy may be drawn
between the Mayas and Aztecs in the New World
and the Greeks and Romans in the Old, as regards
character, achievements, and relations one to the
other. The Mayas, like the Greeks, were an artistic
and intellectual people who developed sculpture,
painting, architecture, astronomy and other arts
and sciences to a high plane. Politically, both were
divided into communities or states that bickered
and quarreled. There were temporary leagues between
certain cities, but real unity only against a
common enemy. Culturally, both were one people,
in spite of dialectic differences, for the warring factions
were bound together by a common religion and
a common thought. To be sure the religion of the
Mayas was much more barbaric than that of the
Greeks but in each case the subject matter was idealized
and beautified in art.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>The Aztecs, like the Romans, were a brusque and
warlike people who built upon the ruins of an earlier
civilization that fell before the force of their arms
and who made their most, notable contributions to
organization and government. The Toltecs stand
just beyond the foreline of Aztecan history and may
fitly be compared to the Etruscans. They were the
possessors of a culture derived in part from their
brilliant contemporaries that was magnified to true
greatness by their ruder successors.</p>
<h3>The Chichimecas.</h3>
<p>The term Chichimecas was applied
by the more civilized tribes of the Mexican
highlands to those nomads outside the pale who
dressed in skins and hunted with the bow and arrow.
Some of these wandering groups spoke Nahuan dialects,
but the term was also applied to the Otomis
who spoke a distinct language. Possibly through
having been reduced in war certain of these wandering
groups were drawn into civilization and when
the Toltecan cities began to decline, they advanced
to considerable power and prestige. In fact, the
Aztecs may be considered as originally Chichimecan,
along with the people of Texcoco. In later
times, these city-broken nomads looked back with
considerable pride on their lowly origin. The early
life in the open is pictured interestingly in several
documents including the Map of Tlotzin and the
Map of Quinatzin.</p>
<p>We have already seen how the splendid culture
of the Toltecan cities broke down under the weight
of civil war about 1220 A. D. To be sure, Cholula
appears to have kept alive the flame of Toltecan religion
and art up to the advent of the Spaniards.
Atzcapotzalco, Colhuacan, and other towns near the
lakes that had been established during the Toltecan
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
period were able to hold their own for a time against
the newer order.</p>
<p>Xolotl, founder of the dynasty of Texcoco, makes
his first appearance in the Valley of Mexico in 1225,
five years after the dispersion of the Toltecs, according
to the Codex Xolotl. He viewed the abandoned
cities but neither he nor his immediate successors
chose to lead a sedentary life. The first
date appears too early because it seems unlikely
that the reigns of Xolotl and his son actually covered
ninety years. The foundation of Texcoco took
place in the reign of Techotlala and Ixtlilxochitl,
his son, fell a victim to the murderous policy of
Tezozomoc, the famous tyrant of Atzcapotzalco.
Nezahualcoyotl, who regained the throne in 1431
was a great poet, philosopher, and law maker. The
rulers of Texcoco were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>Aztecan History.</h3>
<p>The history of the Aztecs has a
mythological preamble in common with other nations
of Mexico. The Chicomoztoc or Seven Caves
must not be considered historical but simply man&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
place of emergence from the underworld. The general
conception of an existence within the earth that
preceded the existence upon the earth is found very
widely among North American Indians. It is likewise
impossible to locate the Island of Aztlan, that
served, according to several codices, as the starting
place of the Mexican migration. The northern origin
for the Aztecan tribe to which so much attention
has been paid need not have been far from the Valley
of Mexico, since in their entire recorded peregrination
they hardly traveled eighty miles.</p>
<p>Owing to the ineffectiveness of the Mexican time
count Aztecan chronology is far from fixed. The
year was known by the day with which it began and
as this day ran the permutation of four names and
thirteen numbers a cycle was fifty-two years in
length. No method of keeping the cycles in their
proper order seems to have been devised except the
laborious one of putting down every year in sequence
whether or not an event occurred in it. According
to different authorities the year 1 Stone
which begins the historical account in the Aubin
Codex was 648, 1064, or 1168 in the European
calendar, each date differing from the others by
multiples of fifty-two years. The last base, 1168,
is correct; this being the epoch of the Toltec Era
established by Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>The wandering tribes, among which may be mentioned
the Chalca, Xochimilca, Tlahuica, Huexotzinca,
Tepaneca, and Azteca, pushed their way into
the region of the lakes and were allowed to live in
less desirable locations as vassals to the established
tribes. The &ldquo;peregrinations&rdquo; relate the succession
of stops and the length of each stop. The Aztecs
themselves made twenty or more stops lasting from
two to twenty years. Finally, about 1325, they
reached Chapultepec and for a number of years
lived in comparative peace and quiet. Their bad
manners and growing power excited the enmity of
several nearby towns and in 1351 the
Aztecs, under their chieftain Huitzilihuitl,
were worsted in a fierce battle.
Remnants of the tribe, including
Huitzilihuitl and his daughter, sought
the protection of Cozcoztli, king of
Colhuacan. They soon were able to
repay his support in a war with
Xochimilco. The first actual settlement
on the site of the future Tenochtitlan
was made in 1364 and in 1376
Acamapictli, a noble allied to the
royal house of Colhuacan, was elected
to be the first war chief of the new
city.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the first improvements undertaken
by the new city was in the
matter of water supply. Rights were
secured to the famous spring of Chapultepec,
an important gain because
the brackish waters of the lake were not fit to drink.
A double water main of terra cotta was laid from
the springs to the town. New land was made, probably
after the manner still to be seen in the famous
floating gardens of Xochimilco by throwing the soil
from the bed of the shallow lake into enclosed areas
of wattle work. Gradually a Venice-like city, traversed
by canals and admirably protected from attack,
rose from the lake. At the coming of the
Spaniards there were three causeways leading to
the shores of the lake and each of these was protected
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
by drawbridges. There was a city wall upon
which were lighthouses for the guidance of homecoming
fishermen. There were palaces and market
places and a great central plaza called the Tecpan,
where were situated the principal temples.</p>
<p>The Spaniards destroyed the ancient city, blocking
up the canals with the d&eacute;bris of temples, and
building the new City of Mexico over the leveled
ruins. Ancient relics are brought to light wherever
excavations are made. In 1900 many sculptures
and ceremonial objects were uncovered in Escalerillas
street near the Cathedral. Recently a building
near the National Museum was torn down for replacement
and in digging for new foundations part
of the base of the great pyramid was found. This
had been enlarged several times, as could be seen
by the stairways successively buried under new
walls. At the bottom of the balustrade of one stairway
a great serpent head of stone was found in its
original position (<a href="#plXL">Plate XL</a>).</p>
<p>The Aztecs count their history as a great people
from their first war chief Acamapichtli who commenced
his rule in 1376 (Codex Aubin). The names
and the order of the succeeding war chiefs are the
same in several records, but the dates are found to
vary slightly.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>After throwing off the yoke of their early overlords,
the Tepanecas, by the subjection of Atzcapotzalco
at the beginning of the brilliant reign of
Itzcouatl, the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan entered into a
three-cornered league with Texcoco and Tlacopan
(Tacuba). This was an offensive and defensive alliance
with an equal division of the spoils of war.
Soon the united power of these three cities dominated
the Valley of Mexico and began to be felt
across the mountains on every side. Tenochtitlan
gradually assumed the commanding position in the
league, and although Texcoco continued to be an
important center the third member was apparently
much reduced. The great votive stone of Tizoc records
some of the earlier conquests of the Aztecs.
At the arrival of Cortez only a few important cities
such as Tlaxcala retained their independence. But
the crest of power had then been passed and it
seems pretty certain that the remarkable city in the
lake would in time have suffered the fate of other
self-constituted capitals both in the Old World and
the New.</p>
<h3>Social Organization.</h3>
<p>Spanish historians often
liken Tenochtitlan to the seat of an empire and
speak of the ruler as one who had the power of an
absolute monarch while other and more recent writers
have declared that the tribal organization of the
Aztecs was essentially democratic. The truth
doubtless lies between these extremes. The people
were warlike by nature and all men, except a few
of the priesthood, were soldiers. Honors depended
largely upon success in war and warriors were arranged
in ranks according to their deeds. The
common warriors formed one rank and next came
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
those who had distinguished themselves by definite
achievements which gave the right to wear certain
articles of dress or to bear certain titles. The
chiefs were elected for an indefinite term of office
from the most distinguished fighters and could be
removed for cause.</p>
<p>But while the offices of state were elective there
was, nevertheless, a tendency to choose from certain
powerful families and at least the foundation of an
aristocratic policy. A chief was succeeded by his
son or brother except when these candidates were
manifestly unfit. In the actual succession of the
great war chiefs of Tenochtitlan, a peculiar system
seems to have been followed in that the candidates
from the older generation were ordinarily exhausted
before the next lower generation became
eligible. Thus Huitzilihuitl, Chimalpopoca, and
Itzcouatl were all sons of Acamapichtli, and the
last and greatest was born of a slave mother. Then
followed Moctezuma Ilhuicamina I, the son of Huitzilihuitl.
This chief had no male heirs but the
children of his daughter ruled in order: Axayacatl,
Tizoc, and Ahuitzotl. Moctezuma II was the son
of the first of these as was Cuitlahua, while Cuauhtemoc,
the last Aztec ruler, was the son of Ahuitzotl.
This peculiar succession was not in vogue in Texcoco,
where son succeeded father and the lawful
wife was chosen from the royalty of Tenochtitlan.
In the various annals, the genealogies are often
indicated and the evidence that aristocracies existed
is too strong to be overthrown. There are even
cases of queens who succeeded to the chief power
after the death of the royal husband.</p>
<p>It is extremely doubtful whether the Aztecs ever
had what might be called clans. We have seen that
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
there were originally eight closely related tribes
constituting the Mexica or Mexici nation. The
Aztecs themselves are said to have been divided into
seven groups that were first reduced to four or five
and then increased to about twenty. It is not clear
that these were exogamic kinship groups. They
were probably military societies taking into their
membership all the men of the tribe. The name
<i>Calpolli</i>, or &ldquo;great house,&rdquo; which was applied to
them seems to have referred to a sort of barracks
or general meeting place in each ward or division
of the city where arms and trophies were kept and
the youth educated in the art of war. The title in
land was held by the <i>calpolli</i> and the right of use
distributed among the heads of families who held
possession only so long as the land was worked.
Each <i>calpolli</i> seems to have had a certain autonomy
in governmental matters as well as a local religious
organization. It is curious to find in Salvador, far
to the south, the word <i>calpolli</i> applied to the platform
mounds that surround courts in the ancient
ruins. This use of the word may indicate that the
&ldquo;great houses&rdquo; of the different societies were ordinarily
the principal buildings of the city and that
they were used for civil, military, and religious
purposes.</p>
<p>In forming judgment on the fundamentals of
social organization among the Aztecs we must remember
that no clear case of kinship clans has been
reported south of the area of the United States.
Among the Cakchiquels, a Mayan tribe of the Guatemalan
highlands, two royal houses are reported
from which the ruling chief was alternately drawn.
The Zotzils have been explained as a bat clan because
their name is associated with the word for
bat and because a bat god appears to have been their
patron deity. The Mazatecas and Mixtecas, Deer
people and Cloud people, also have clanlike names
but in all cases these are designations of entire
tribes, not of subdivisions of tribes.</p>

<p>Tenochtitlan was divided into four quarters and
each quarter subdivided into a number of wards.
An under chief was elected from each of the subdivisions
which are doubtless to be identified with
the <i>calpolli</i>, and an over chief from each of the four
quarters. Above these stood the war chief of the
entire tribe who was likewise elected, but within the
limits of a fixed aristocracy. A second great chief,
who seems to have been a peace officer with some
important relation to the priesthood, was nominally
equal to the war chief, but practically much less
powerful. The real center of the home government
was a council made up of all the chiefs. In time of
war the war chief was in supreme command and
could either delegate his rights or act in person.
Just how much the priesthood intervened in governmental
affairs cannot be definitely put in words, but
their power was doubtless great. Certain lands
were cultivated in common for the officers of church
and state and much of the tribute from conquered
provinces was devoted to their needs.</p>

<p>The ceremonial center of Tenochtitlan has been transformed
into the civic center of Mexico City. The Cathedral,
the National Palace, and the Zocolo, or Plaza
Major, mark the site where once stood the famous
Tecpan or temple enclosure. Within the serpent
walls, according to Sahagun, there were twenty-five
temple pyramids, five oratories, sundry fasting
houses, four bowl-shaped stones, one disk-shaped
stone, a great stepped altar, a &ldquo;star column,&rdquo; seven
skull racks, two ball courts, two enclosed areas, a
well, three bathing places, two cellar-like rooms, a
dancing place, nine priest houses, a prison for the
gods of conquered nations, arsenals, work places,
etc. A native plan of the Tecpan, much simplified,
occurs in the Sahagun manuscript. The great pyramid
rose in several terraces and was surmounted by
two temples each three stories in height, one dedicated
to Huitzilopochtli and the other to Tlaloc.
Each temple contained an image of the god to which
it was dedicated and a sacrificial altar. The walls
were encrusted with blood of human victims whose
hearts, still beating, had been torn out for divine
food and whose bodies had been rolled down the
steep flight of temple stairs. The foundations for
the great pyramids were laid in 1447 by Moctezuma
I, the pyramids were completed in 1485 while Tizoc
was war chief and the final dedication ceremonies
were held in 1487.</p>
<p>Several very interesting large sculptures and
many minor objects have been unearthed on the site
of the Tecpan. In 1790 and 1791 were found three
famous monoliths, the Calendar Stone, the Stone of
Tizoc (Sacrificial Stone), and the Statue of Coatlicue.
Since 1897 many fine pieces of pottery and
several sculptures have been excavated near the
Cathedral and placed in the Museo Nacional.</p>

<h3>The Calendar Stone.</h3>
<p>The great sculptured monument
known as the Calendar Stone or Stone of the
Sun, is the most valuable object that has come down
intact from the time of the Aztecs. It is a single
piece of porphyry, irregular except for the sculptured
face. It now weighs over twenty tons and it
is estimated that the original weight was over twice
as much. The sculptured disk is about twelve feet
in diameter. This great stone was transported by
men over many miles of marshy lake bottom before
it could be placed in position in front of the Temple
of the Sun in the temple enclosure that has just
been described. The stone was doubtless thrown
down from its original position by the soldiers of
Cortez and may have been lost to sight. We know,
however, that it was exposed to view about 1560 and
was then buried by order of the archbishop of Mexico
City lest its presence should cause the Indians
to revert to their original pagan beliefs. It was rediscovered
in 1790 and was afterwards built into the
fa&ccedil;ade of the Cathedral where it remained until
1885, when it was removed to the nearby museum.</p>
<p>The Calendar Stone is not only a symbol of the
sun&rsquo;s face marked with the divisions of the year
but it is a record of the cosmogonic myth of the
Aztecs and the creations and destructions of the
world. In the center is the face of the sun god,
Tonatiuh, enclosed in the middle of the symbol
called Olin. Tonatiuh is often represented by a
much simpler sign of a circle with four or more
subdivisions resembling those of a compass which
are intended to represent the rays of the sun. Olin
is one of the day signs and means movement, or perhaps
earthquake. It has also been explained as a
graphic representation of the apparent course of
the sun during the year. The history of the world,
according to the Aztecan myth, is divided into five
suns or ages, four of which refer to the past and
one to the present. The present sun is called Olin
Tonatiuh because it is destined to be destroyed by
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
an earthquake. The day signs of the four previous
suns are represented in the rectangular projections
of the central Olin symbol beginning at the upper
right hand corner and proceeding to the left. They
are 4 Ocelotl (jaguar); 4 Ehecatl (wind); 4 Quauhtli
(rain); 4 Atl (water), and they refer to destruction,
first, by jaguars, second, by a hurricane, third, by a
volcanic rain of fire, fourth, by a flood. It is claimed
by some that the year 13 Acatl (reed) recorded at
the top of the monument between the reptile tails
refers to the first year of the present sun. The fifth
sun will end with the day 4 Olin, that is expressed in
the central symbol already described. For this reason
a fast was held on each recurrence of this day.
Outside of the Olin symbol but between its arms are
four hieroglyphs of uncertain meaning. Next to
this area dealing with the great ages of the world
comes a band of the twenty day signs of the Aztecan
month. Outside of this band are several others
which probably represent in a conventionalized
manner the rays of the sun and the turquoise and
eagle feathers with which the sun disk was believed
to be decorated. Finally, outside of all, are two
plumed monsters meeting face to face at the bottom
of the disk. In each reptile face is seen a human
face in profile. These reptiles are probably to be
identified as the Xiuhcoatl or Fire Serpents.</p>
<p>The newly discovered National Stone pictures the
Calendar Stone in vertical position on a mound and
at the head of a flight of steps. The dates on the
side of the stairway are 1 Tochtli and 2 Acatl, 1506
and 1507, indicating that the Calendar Stone was
dedicated in connection with the New Fire Ceremony.
The design on the back of this new-found
monument pictures the eagle on the cactus, symbolic
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
of the founding of Tenochtitlan. Other sculptures
adorn the sides, the top, and the bottom of the
stone.</p>
<h3>Stone of Tizoc.</h3>
<p>The Sacrificial Stone or Stone of
Tizoc is believed to have been carved by order of
Tizoc, the war chief who ruled from 1482-1486, as
a memorial offering to Mexican arms on the completion
of the great temple
to the Mexican God of
War. The stone was a
<i>quauhxicalli</i>, or &ldquo;eagle
bowl.&rdquo; This name was
given to large bowls
which were used to hold
the blood and the heart
of human victims sacrificed
to the gods. The
same name was extended
to the large
drum-shaped stone,
under consideration,
which has a pit in the
center and a sort of
canal running from the
center to one side which
may have been intended to drain off the blood. Human
sacrifice actually took place on this stone but it
is pretty certain that it was not one of the <i>temalacatl</i>
or &ldquo;gladiator stones&rdquo; on which were staged
mortal combats as ceremonies. According to description
the gladiator stones were pierced by a
hole in the center so that one or more captives could
be bound fast by a rope.</p>

City (Tenochtitlan). On all the other surfaces priests and religious
symbols are drawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>On the top of the Stone of Tizoc is a representation
of Tonatiuh, or the sun&rsquo;s disk, much less complex
than that which we have seen on the Calendar
Stone but with many similar parts. On the sides of
the stone are fifteen groups of figures, each group
representing a conqueror and his captive. The victorious
soldier appears each time in the guise of the
war god, Huitzilopochtli, or his wizard brother Tezcatlipoca.
The left foot of the figure ends in two
scroll-like objects that may represent the humming
bird feathers that formed the left foot of Huitzilopochtli.
But Tezcatlipoca also had a deformed
foot. Moreover, on the side of the headdress is a
disk with a flame-shaped object coming out of it.
This may represent the smoking mirror of Tezcatlipoca.
The captive wears costumes that change
slightly from one figure to the next. Over the head
of the captive in each instance is the hieroglyph of
a captured town or district.</p>
<p>Nearly all the place name hieroglyphs have been
deciphered. The list is interesting historically because
it gives the principal conquests up to the reign
of Tizoc. Starting at the side directly across the
stone from the groove or drain we see that the figure
of the victor has behind his head a hieroglyph that
represents a leg. This is the hieroglyph of Tizoc
and the victim in this case represents the district of
Matlatzinco in the Valley of Toluca. This district
was brought under subjection by Tizoc himself.
Among the other conquered cities are such well-known
ones as Chalco, Xochimilco, and Colhuacan
in the vicinity of Lake Texcoco and Ahuilizapan
(Orizaba) and Tuxpan that are more distant.</p>

<p>The famous statue of the Earth Goddess,
Coatlicue, &ldquo;the goddess with the serpent
skirt,&rdquo; is one of the most striking examples of
barbaric imagination. The name Teoyamiqui is
often given to this uncouth figure, but the identification
is faulty. Like the other great sculptures we
have just examined, it doubtless occupied an important
place in the great ceremonial center of
Tenochtitlan, but no ancient reference to it is extant.
This goddess is reported to have been the mother
of the gods.</p>

</div>
<p>The statue may be described as follows: The feet
are furnished with claws. The skirt is a writhing
mass of braided rattlesnakes. The arms are doubled
up and the hands are snake heads on a level
with the shoulders. Around the neck and hanging
down over the breast is a necklace of alternating
hands and hearts with a death&rsquo;s head pendant. The
head of this monstrous woman is the same on front
and back and is formed of two serpent heads that
meet face to face. The forked tongue and the four
downward pointing fangs belong half and half to
each of the two profile faces.</p>
<h3>Mexican Writing.</h3>
<p>The means of record employed
in Mexican codices are in part pictographic
and in part hieroglyphic. The sequence of the historical
events in these native manuscripts is often
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
indicated by a line of footprints leading from one
place or scene of action to another. Historical records
of this type resemble old-fashioned maps and
some are actually called maps. The names of towns
in these documents are represented by true hieroglyphs
and often the character of the country is
indicated by pictures of typical vegetation, such as
maguey plants for the highlands and palms for the
lowlands. The day or the year in which took place
the foundation of the town or whatever event is
intended to be recorded is usually placed in conjunction
with the hieroglyph or picture. Conquest
is indicated by a place name hieroglyph with a spear
thrust into it or by a temple on fire, while warfare is
a shield and bundle of lances encircled by footprints.</p>

<p>A few examples of Nahuan hieroglyphs will now
be given to illustrate this interesting method of
writing. It must be remembered that there is
nothing in the nature of a connected narrative.
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
The hieroglyphs or word pictures are limited to
geographical and personal names, including the
names of gods, to months, days, numbers, objects of
commerce and a few objects or ideas of ceremonial
import. Some of the signs are in no degree realistic
and have a definite meaning by common consent
alone, such as the symbol for gold (<a href="#fig73">Fig. 73</a>).
Others are abbreviated and conventionalized pictures
of objects. Thus the head of a god or of an
animal frequently appears as the sign of the whole.
But the most important and interesting word signs
are rebuses in which separate syllables or groups of
syllables are represented by more or less conventionalized
pictures. The whole word picture is a
combination of syllable pictures which indicate
phonetically the word as a whole. Very often advantage
is taken of puns on whole or partial words,
while color and position are also employed to indicate
sounds and syllables.</p>

As for the gods, the faces are usually pictured, especially
when these are grotesque, but sometimes details
of dress or an object connected with a special
ceremony is sufficient to recall the divinity. The
Mexican system of numbers was based on twenties.
The units were figured by dots, the twenties by flags,
the four hundreds by a device like a tree that represented
hair, and the eight thousands by the ceremonial
pouches in which copal incense was carried.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<h3>Aztecan Religion.</h3>
<p>The religion of the Aztecs, like
that of the Mayas, was a polytheism in which special
divinities controlled the powers of nature and the
activities of men. The gods were perhaps further
advanced towards human form and attributes than
were those of the earlier culture to the south, but
definite characterization was still accomplished by
grotesque features and certain animal connections
were still evident. The matter is confused beyond
the point of analysis. The mythologies often
ascribe different origins to the same deity. One
god is addressed by many names, descriptive or
figurative, that are intended to bring out the various
aspects of his power. Overlapping functions make
it impossible to assign each god to his special province.
There are universal gods, there are special
gods, and there are patron gods of trade guilds.
Moreover, there are foreign gods, some recent, some
ancient.</p>
<p>The religion of central Mexico had its objective,
ritualistic side, which appealed directly to the
understanding of the masses, and its more subtle
theological or philosophical side seen, for instance,
in the poems written by priests and rulers. It was
a mixture of spirituality and the grossest idolatry.
The ceremonial calendar, with a description of the
feasts and sacrifices occurring at different times of
the year, has been preserved in a number of documents.
Pageants, incense-burning, and human
sacrifice gave a strong dramatic quality to the religious
rites.</p>

<p>The conception of a supreme deity is seen in <i>Ometeuctli</i>,
the Lord of Duality, a vague god-head and
creator who is sometimes
addressed in some of the
religious poems as the
&ldquo;Cause of All.&rdquo; In the
background of the popular
religion was the belief in
the Earth Mother and the
Sky Father and in the
divinity of the Sun, the
Moon, the Jaguar, the
Serpent, and whatever
else was beautiful, powerful,
and inexplicable.
Tezcatlipoca, by reason
of his magic and his
omniscience, was placed
at the head of the pantheon
of active gods.
Huitzilopochtli was, however,
the favorite god of
the Aztecs through his relation
to war. Tlaloc, the
god of rain, was naturally
of great importance to
agriculturists living in a
rather arid region. Tonatiuh,
the Sun God, was
a more or less abstract
deity who acted in part
through other gods. But
the list is too long to be repeated here.</p>

<p>Of gods with a foreign origin perhaps the most
important were Quetzalcoatl and Xipe. The former
was introduced long before
the Aztecs raised their
banner of war and was the
Long-nosed God of the
Mayas, introduced under the
patronage of Quetzalcoatl,
the powerful emperor of the
Toltecs. The worship of
Xipe is said to have originated
in a town in southern
Mexico. It had certainly
taken a strong hold on the
Aztecs of Mexico City and
was likewise known as far
south as Salvador. It has
recently been demonstrated
that the people of Yopico,
specially given to the worship
of Xipe, originated in Nicaragua.</p>

<h3>Conceptions of the Universe.</h3>
<p>Cosmogonic myths,
the world over, are unscientific attempts to explain
the creation of the universe, to outline the powers
of the gods and to trace the development of nature.
The cosmogonic myths of Mexico and Central America
are characterized by multiple creations. The
Aztecan belief in five suns each standing for a world
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
epoch is paralleled in fragments of Mayan mythology.
Creation is not emphasized so much as destruction.
The sequence of the suns is figured on
the Calendar Stone, and in one of the codices, besides
being explained in some of the early writings
of Spanish priests and educated natives. The first
sun was devoured by a jaguar and in the resulting
darkness the inhabitants of the earth were devoured
by jaguars. The second sun was destroyed by a
hurricane, the third by a rain of fire, and the fourth
by a flood. One human pair escaped each cataclysm
and lived to repopulate the world. The fifth or
present sun will be destroyed by an earthquake.</p>
<p>Notions of the shape and character of the universe
are pretty well defined in Aztecan lore. The
widespread belief that the universe consists of three
superimposed worlds, the upper or sky world, the
middle world of living men and the under world of
the dead, is found in a developed form. The upper
world is divided into thirteen levels. The uppermost
four levels are called <i>Teteocan</i>, the abode of
the gods, and are considered to be invisible. The
creator of all, Ometeuctli, Lord of Duality, dwells
with his spouse in the highest heaven and under him
in order are the Place of the Red God of Fire, the
Place of the Yellow Sun God and the Place of the
White Evening Star God. The inferior heavens,
called <i>Ilhuicatl</i>, are given over to the visible celestial
activities. There is one heaven for the storms,
another for the blue sky of the day, the dark sky of
the night, the comets, the evening star, the sun, the
stars, etc.</p>
<p>The under world is <i>Mictlan</i>, the Place of the Dead.
Nine divisions are commonly given and in the lowermost
of these lives <i>Mictlanteuctli</i>, the Lord of
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
Death, and his mate. The idea of future blessing
or punishment is not entirely absent from the minds
of the Aztecs. Warriors killed in battle go to the
House of the Sun, in one of the upper worlds, as do
women who die in childbirth. <i>Tlalocan</i>, the lowermost
heaven, is a sort of terrestrial paradise for
others. <i>Mictlan</i> is, however, the common abode of
the dead, and the wretched soul can reach it only
after a journey set with horrors.</p>
<p>The cult of the quarters is intimately associated
with the concept of the universe. With the four
cardinal points a number of others are sometimes
taken including the zenith, the nadir, and the middle.
The sacred numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7 may thus
conceivably be derived from the points of space,
but it would be very unsafe to assume that they are
necessarily so derived. The general concept of a
universe divided into quarters, fifths, or sixths is a
powerful conventionalizing factor in mythology, religion,
and art. Prayers, songs, and important acts
are repeated in identical or in systematically varied
form for each point of space. In Mayan and Aztecan
codices the symbolism of the four directions
is often manifest.</p>
<h3>Ceremonies.</h3>
<p>Ceremonialism was intensely developed
in Mexico and the dramatic quality of many
Aztecan rites of human sacrifice has probably never
been equaled. We are apt to think only of the gruesome
features of human sacrifice and to overlook
the spiritual ones. The victim was often regarded
as a personification of a god and as such he was
f&ecirc;ted, clothed in fine garments, and given every
honor. Efforts were made to cause the victim to go
willingly to his death uplifted by a truly religious
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
ecstasy. It was considered unlucky that he should
grieve or falter.</p>
<p>The religious calendar was given over to fixed and
movable feasts. The fixed feasts were eighteen in
number and each came on the last day of a twenty-day
period and gave its name to that period. These
eighteen periods correspond with the Mayan uinals
or months, but since dates were rarely given in
relation to them, they do not have the same calendrical
importance. The five days that rounded out
the 365-day year were considered unlucky.</p>
<p>Each of the eighteen feasts of the year was under
the patronage of a special divinity and each had a
set of ceremonies all its own. In some cases the
ceremonies were really culminations of long periods
of preparation. Thus, on the last day of the month
Toxcatl there was sacrificed a young man, chosen
from captured chieftains for his beauty and accomplishments,
who for an entire year had been fitting
himself for his one turn on the stage of blood and
death. This intended victim, gayly attired and accompanied
by a retinue of pages, was granted the
freedom of the city. When the month of Toxcatl
entered he was given brides, whose names were
those of goddesses, and in his honor was held a
succession of brilliant festivals. On the last day
there was a parade of canoes across Lake Texcoco
and when a certain piece of desert land was reached,
the brides and courtiers bade farewell to the victim.
His pages accompanied him by a little-used trail to
the base of an apparently ruined temple. Here he
was stripped of his splendid garments and of the
jewels that were symbols of divinity. With only a
necklace of flutes he mounted the steps of the pyramid.
At each step he broke one of the flutes and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
arrived at the summit, where the priests waited,
knife in hand, a naked man whose heart was to be
offered to the very god he had impersonated. This
ceremony is given only as an example, but it illustrates
two characteristics that are seen in several
other sacrifices, namely, the paying of homage and
honor to the intended sacrificial victim, and, secondly,
the necessity of keeping the victim in a happy
frame of mind.</p>
<p>The eleventh feast of the year was called Ochpaniztli,
&ldquo;the feast of the broom&rdquo; and was celebrated
in honor of the goddess known as Toci, or
Teteoinnan. The first of these names means &ldquo;our
female ancestor&rdquo; and the second one means &ldquo;the
mother of the gods.&rdquo; She was a goddess of the
earth and her symbol was the grass broom with
which the earth was swept. She also exerted an
influence over the arts of the hearth, such as weaving.
Her pictures in the codices show her with a
broom in one hand and a shield in the other while
about her head is a band of unspun cotton into
which are stuck spindles wrapped with thread.</p>
<p>During this month the roads were repaired, the
houses and plazas swept, and the temples and idols
refurbished. According to the text in the Codex
Magliabecchiano there were human sacrifices in the
temples which fronted on the roads and there were
great dances and carousals. Those sacrificed were
afterwards flayed as in the feast of Xipe and their
skins worn by dancers. The picture that accompanies
this revolting admission is itself devoid of
any morbid symbols. It shows a kneeling woman
holding out the broom and shield. She wears a
white dress and a neckless of jade beads with golden
bells for pendants. Below her are two standing
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
men who bear in their hands offerings of ripe fruit.</p>
<p>Sahagun gives details of a terrible drama that
was enacted during this twenty-day month. For
the first eight days there was dancing without song
and without the drum. After this prologue a
woman was chosen to impersonate the patron goddess
and to wear her characteristic dress and
ornaments. With her was a retinue of women
skilled in medicine and midwifery. For four days
these persons divided in opposing ranks and pelted
each other with leaves and flowers. While this
harmless ceremony and others like it were being
acted out, the greatest care was taken that the
woman who played the r&ocirc;le of the goddess and who
was marked for death should not suspect her fate.
It was considered unlucky, indeed, if this victim
wept or was sad. When her time to die had come
she was clothed in rich garments and given to understand
that she should be that night the bride of a
rich lord. And under such a beguiling belief she
was led silently to the temple of sacrifice. There
without warning an attendant lifted her upon himself,
back to back, and her head was instantly struck
off. Without delay the skin was stripped from her
warm body and a youth, wearing it as a garment,
was conducted in the midst of captives to the temple
of the War God, Huitzilopochtli. Here in the presence
of this mighty god the youth himself tore out
the hearts of four victims and then abandoned the
rest to the knife of the head priest. Thus closed
the terrible drama which began with an innocent
battle of flowers and ended in an orgy of blood.</p>
<p>The twelfth month passed under two names. It
was called Pachtli after a plant with which the temples
were decorated and Teotleco which signifies
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
&ldquo;the arrival of the gods.&rdquo; The principal feast was
held, as usual, on the twentieth day when the great
company of gods was supposed to return from a
far land. One god, very youthful and robust, arrived
on the eighteenth day, being able to outwalk
the others, while a few very old and infirm divinities
were late in getting to the feast. The one who arrived
first was called Telpochtli or Titlacauan but
in reality he was the great Tezcatlipoca in disguise.</p>
<p>In anticipation of this return, the temples,
shrines, and household idols were decorated with
branches. The youths who did this work were repaid
in corn, the amount varying from a full basket
to a few ears. A novel manner of attesting the
earliest presence of divinity is related. Some cornmeal
was spread in a circular mass upon the ground.
During the night the high priests kept vigil and
from time to time visited this circle of cornmeal.
When he saw a footprint in the center he cried out,
&ldquo;Our master has come.&rdquo; Then there was a burst
of music and everyone ran to the great feast in the
temple. Much native wine was drunk, for this was
considered equivalent to washing the tired feet of
the travel-worn gods. As a final act of the celebration
there was a dance in costume around a great
fire and several unfortunates were tossed alive into
the flames.</p>
<p>Space will not permit a further examination of
the eighteen fixed feasts. The movable feasts were
mostly in definite relation to the <i>tonalamatl</i> and
were thus subject to repetition every 260 days.
The permutation of twenty day names and thirteen
numbers is pictured in Mexican codices in two or
more stereotyped forms, but these are very complete.
In the commonest form the entire cycle is
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
divided into twenty groups of thirteen days each
and each group is presided over by a special divinity.
There are other repeating series of gods,
sacred birds, etc., that preside over the individual
days in these groups. The <i>tonalamatl</i> was much
used in Mexico in connection with foretelling events.
The days were lucky, indifferent, or unlucky, and
the future life of a child was believed to be locked
up in the horoscope of his birthday.</p>
<p>Other feasts were held in relation to longer time
periods. There were important festivals held in
connection with the planet Venus with especially
elaborate ones falling at intervals of eight years.
Still another ceremony was held at the completion
of a fifty-two year period, when the set of years
were figuratively bundled up and laid away and a
new sacred fire lighted.</p>
<h3>Poetry and Music.</h3>
<p>The languages of Central
America were capable of considerable literary development.
This is seen especially in the songs that
were used in different religious ceremonies of the
Aztecs, as well as in the reflective poems written by
educated natives. Several very fine pieces have
been preserved, and while there is no rhyme, there
is much rhythm. When recited by a person speaking
fluently the native tongue these poems are very
impressive. Of course, translation is always hazardous,
and fundamental differences in language,
such as exist between English and Aztecan, make it
almost impossible. The most famous poet whose
name has come down to us was Nezahualcoyotl, or
Famishing Coyote, who was a ruler of Texcoco and
died at the advanced age of eighty years in 1472.
A few verses from one of his poems on the mutability
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
of life and the certainty of death have been
translated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the earth is a grave, and naught escapes it; nothing is so
perfect that it does not fall and disappear. The rivers, brooks,
fountains and waters flow on, and never return to their joyous beginnings;
they hasten on to the vast realms of Tlaloc, and the wider
they spread between their marges the more rapidly do they mould
their own sepulchral urns. That which was yesterday is not today;
and let not that which is today trust to live tomorrow.</p>
<p>The caverns of earth are filled with pestilential dust which once
was the bones, the flesh, the bodies of great ones who sat upon
thrones, deciding causes, ruling assemblies, governing armies, conquering
provinces, possessing treasures, tearing down temples, flattering
themselves with pride, majesty, fortune, praise and dominion.
These glories have passed like the dark smoke thrown out by the
fires of Popocatepetl, leaving no monuments but the rude skins on
which they are written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example will serve to emphasize the
strain of sadness and the vision of death that characterize
so many Aztecan poems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sad and strange it is to see and reflect on the prosperity and
power of the old and dying king Tezozomoc; watered with ambition
and avarice, he grew like a willow tree rising above the grass and
flowers of spring, rejoicing for a long time, until at length withered
and decayed, the storm wind of death tore him from his roots and
dashing him in fragments to the ground. The same fate befell the
ancient King Colzatzli, so that no memory was left of him, nor of
his lineage.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>The Aztecs held concerts in the open air where
poems were sung to the accompaniment of the drum
and other simple instruments. Songs were also
sung at banquets and in the stress of love and war.
The common musical instruments of the Aztecs vary
but little from those in use elsewhere in Mexico and
Central America. There were two kinds of drums.
One was a horizontal hollowed-out log with an
H-shaped cutting made longitudinally on its upper
surface so as to form two vibrating strips which
were struck with wooden drumsticks having tips of
rubber. The second sort of drum was an upright
log also hollowed out and covered with a drumhead
of deerskin. Conches were used for trumpets.
Resonator whistles with or without finger holes
were made of clay in fanciful shapes. Flageolets
were constructed of clay, bone, or wood and flutes
were made of reed. Resounding metal disks and
tortoise shells were beaten in time. Many sorts of
gourd and earthenware rattles were employed as
well as notched bones which were rasped with a
scraping stick. Copper bells of the sleigh bell type
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
were exceedingly common. The marimba, however,
that is such a favorite musical instrument today in
Central America is of African origin and fairly
recent introduction. No stringed instruments were
known to the ancient Mexicans nor does the pan-pipe
appear to have been used in this area although
common in Peru.</p>
<h3>Minor Aztecan Arts.</h3>
<p>Some of the great sculptures
of Tenochtitlan have already been described
and references have been made to the native books
painted in brilliant colors on paper and deerskin.
Objects of minor art comprise pottery vessels, ornaments
of gold, silver, copper, jade, and other precious
materials, textiles, pieces of feather work, etc.</p>
<p>The best known ceramic products are made of
orange colored clay and carry designs in black that
sometimes are realistic, but more often not. The
tripod dishes with the bottoms roughed by cross
scoring were used to grind chili. Heavy bowls with
loop handles on the sides and a channel across the
bottom were seemingly made to be strung on ropes.
They may have held pitch and been used for street
lights. The pottery figurines of the Aztecan period
are nearly all moulded and lack the sharp detail of
the earlier examples. They often represent deities
wearing characteristic dress and carrying ceremonial
objects.</p>
<p>Comparatively few specimens of ancient gold
work in Mexico escaped the cupidity of the Spanish
conquerors, but these attest a remarkable proficiency
in casting. The moulds were made of clay
mixed with ground charcoal and the melting of gold
was accomplished by means of a blow pipe. The
technique seen in Costa Rican gold work according
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
to which details falsely appear to be added by soldered
wire, was followed in Mexico. Modern Mexican
filigree bears little relation to the ancient Indian
work, but is probably of Moorish origin. The
examples of Aztecan gold work include finger rings,
earrings, nose and lip ornaments, necklaces, and
pendants.</p>
<p>Among the precious and semi-precious stones
known to the Aztecs, the most valuable in their eyes
was turquoise. This was probably obtained by
trade from the Pueblo Indians. It was mostly cut
into thin plates and used in the manufacture of mosaic
objects. Red jasper, green jade, jet, gold, and
shell of various colors was also used in these mosaics.
Jade was highly prized and was known as
<i>chalchihuitl</i>. Ornaments
of obsidian, a black volcanic
glass, and of crystal
quartz, are fairly common
and others of opal and
amethyst have been
found. Pearls and emeralds
were secured in trade
from the south.</p>
<div class="img" id="img163">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 82. Mexican Blanket
with the Design that represents
interlacing Sand and Water
called &ldquo;Spider Water.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The textile decorations
in vogue at the coming of
the Spaniards can be restored
from the pictures
in codices. Mantles were
often demanded as tribute and the designs are given
on the conventional bundles in the tribute lists.
Garments with certain designs served as insignia of
office for several of the priesthoods. Feather mosaic
was highly prized and was made according to
several methods. Capes as well as shields and
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
other objects were covered with brilliant feathers
so arranged as to bring out designs in the natural
colors.</p>
<h3>The Tarascans.</h3>
<p>The Aztecs while by far the most
important tribe in the fifteenth century did not dominate
all the surrounding peoples. For instance,
most of the State of Michoacan was controlled by
the Tarascan tribe who defeated every expedition
sent against them. The list of Tarascan towns is
a long one but Tzintzuntzan which means the
&ldquo;Place of the Humming Birds&rdquo; was the capital and
principal stronghold. The ancient history of the
Tarascans is little known. Large and striking
specimens of archaic art were formerly accredited
to this people, but without good reason. It is likely
that archaic characters in art were maintained in
Michoacan after they had passed away in central
Mexico, but we cannot be sure that the Tarascans
were the ancient inhabitants. There is some evidence,
however, of culture which can be associated
with them. The peculiar T-shaped mounds called
<i>yatacas</i>, which rise in terraces and are faced with
stone slabs laid without mortar, may have been
built by this tribe. Sculptures of rather fine quality
are occasionally found, an example being a reclining
god of the type made famous by the &ldquo;Chacmool&rdquo; of
Chichen Itza. Many fine copper celts have been
unearthed in this highly mineralized mountain region.
When the Spaniards came the Tarascans
were skilled in weaving and were particularly famous
for feather mosaics and feather pictures made
largely of the brilliant plumage of humming birds.
The use of the <i>atlatl</i> or spear-thrower survives
among the present-day Indians who also make
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
gourd vessels covered with colored clays in pleasing
geometric and floral designs.</p>
<p>The Otomis are a tribe of central Mexico even
less cultured than the Tarascans and there is some
evidence that they entered this region from the
south only a few centuries before the Spaniards.
Their relatives, the Matlatzincas of the Valley of
Toluca, had more interesting arts.</p>

</div>
<h3>Southern Mexico.</h3>
<p>Somewhere about the middle
of the fifteenth century Moctezuma I planted an
Aztecan colony at Uaxyacac on the edge of the
Zapotecan territory to protect the trade route to
Tabasco. This name gave rise to the modern
Oaxaca. From this point expeditions were sent out
which harrassed the Zapotecs to the south and the
Mixtecs to the west. In the Tribute Roll of Moctezuma
II more than twenty Zapotecan towns are
listed as paying tribute that consisted of gold disks
and gold dust, jadeite beads, quetzal feathers, cochineal
dye, fine textiles, etc. Very little is preserved
concerning the traditional history of southern Mexico,
but it is presumed that the Zapotecan culture
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
before the Aztecan ascendency was a development
of that implanted many centuries before when
Monte Alban flourished and which we have already
examined. As for the Mixtecs we only know that
they produced pottery of great beauty somewhat
similar to that of Cholula.</p>

<p>Some of the finest pre-Cortesian codices that have
come down to us are probably of Zapotecan and
Mixtecan origin although reflecting to some extent
the religion of the Aztecs. Several of these have
been interpreted by Doctor Seler in terms of Aztecan
religion and art. Among the documents from
southern Mexico that belong to the late period
are:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>Several <i>lienzos</i> or documents written on cloth are
also from this region. The Lienzo of Amoltepec
which is a fine example of this class is conserved in
the American Museum of Natural History. The
documents from southern Mexico are distinguished
by details of geometric ornament that resemble the
panels of geometric design on the temples of Mitla.
They record historical events, give astronomical information
and present much pictographic evidence
on various ceremonies and religious usages. In
giving a date a somewhat different method is used
than we have seen in the historical records from the
Valley of Mexico. There is a definite year sign
(<a href="#fig83">Fig. 83</a>) and with it is combined the year bearer,
or initial day of the year, and often the particular
day of the event. Unfortunately, this is not entirely
satisfactory because no month signs are
recorded and a day with a certain name and number
frequently occurs twice in one year. The year
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
bearers are the same as among the Aztecs for most of the documents,
namely, Knife, House, Rabbit, and Reed, but in a manuscript ascribed
to a tribe in southern Mexico called the Cuicatecs, the year bearers
are Wind, Deer, Herb, and Movement (<a href="#fig84">Fig. 84</a>). Conquest of a
town is shown by a spear thrust into the place name. Individuals
are often named after the day on which they were born. Thus
8 Deer is a warrior hero in the Codex Nuttall and 3 Knife is a
woman who also plays a prominent part. In some of the manuscripts
from southern Mexico we see details that are very close to
those in the codices of the Mayas.</p>

<h3>Aztecan Influence in Central America.</h3>
<p>The influence from the late Mexican cultures can be
traced far to the south.
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
Decorative motives that show affiliations to those of
the Aztecs and their immediate predecessors are
found as far south as Costa Rica but the strain is
thin and not to be compared with the evidences of
culture connection over wide territories that are
found on earlier horizons. There was clearly a
brisk trade in gold in Aztecan times between the
Isthmus of Panama and Mexico.</p>
<p>After the breakdown of the civilization of the
humid lands of Central America, following the
Mayan cataclysm, the abandoned regions appear to
have been repopulated by a stream of tribes from
South America who swept up the coast of the Caribbean
Sea and across the peninsula of Yucatan, as
far as Tehuantepec. There was also a strong
northern movement of tribes along the Pacific Coast
seen most clearly in the distribution of languages
belonging to the Chiapanecan or Chorotegan stock.
The early historic records show the Mazateca in
transit from their old home in Costa Rica to their
new one in northern Oaxaca. Cortez in 1526 found
these Indians in Yucatan.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Cross-Section of New World History</span></h3>
<p>This survey of ancient history in Mexico and
Central America discloses a condition which doubtless
holds true of the arch&aelig;ological record in other
parts of the world. The earliest sedentary culture
was by far the most homogeneous and widespread.
This means it modified slowly and lasted for ages.
At the same time, owing to the connection of the
archaic complex with agriculture, the initial spread
may have been rapid. The plants domesticated by
the American Indians were developed far beyond
the wild types, much farther indeed, than the domestic
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
plants of the Old World. This development
must have extended over many centuries. The first
horizon of agriculture was based on plants of an
arid highland environment. The second horizon of
agriculture was based on these same plants after
they had been slowly modified to fit a humid lowland
environment, as well as on certain new plants of
humid lowland origin.</p>
<p>The Maya civilization was specialized to the wet
lowlands of the tropic zone and while the influence
exerted by this dominant culture of the New World
was felt over a great area, the exact characters were
not reproduced elsewhere. Trade relations can be
traced from Yucatan to Colombia on the one hand
and on the other to New Mexico. The cycle of the
Mayan civilization was comparatively short and the
cycles of the resultant civilizations were even
shorter. All New World history must be referred
ultimately to the horizons of culture described
above, with the standard chronology of the Mayas
as the only definite scale.</p>
<p>In the cross-section of New World history presented
herewith the horizontal measures represent
space and the vertical measures represent time.
The line A-B-C-D begins at Victoria Island and
ends at Cape Horn, cutting across the culture areas
named on the diagram. Over a large part of this
cross-section the &ldquo;horizon of recorded history&rdquo; is
in fact the time of the first European exploration,
but in Colombia and Peru, there are well-defined
traditions giving lists of kings, while in Central
America there is exact chronology going back 2000
years before the coming of the white man. Below
this and within it there are arch&aelig;ological records
of culture sequence which in some regions, such as
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
the Pueblo Area, have been nicely classified. On
the basis of trade relations and diffused ideas in material
and esthetic arts the marginal chronology can
be tied in with that of the central standard section
of history. Of course, all dates earlier than the
first recorded ones are theoretical. The beginning
of agriculture in America is put at 4000 B. C.&mdash;it
may be earlier, but can hardly be much later.</p>
<p>In the Pueblo or Southwest Area a single type of
flint corn, doubtless introduced from the south, appears
on the first agricultural level. Contacts with
Mexico and Central America are inferable during
Basket Maker II and III, the latter stratum having
female fetishes roughly comparable with those of
the Archaic Horizon of Mexico. Later Southwest
evolution is autochthonous until the end of Pueblo
III when the concepts of the Plumed Serpent, the
Eagle Man, Four-direction symbolism, etc., come
from Mexico with Toltec trade. Culture sequence
in the Southwest is about as follows:&mdash;</p>

</table>
<p>In Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru culture successions
are now being worked out. The best criterion
of age is found in metals which enter Central America
from South America after the fall of the First
Mayan Empire, i.e., after 630 A. D. The technology
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
of metal working is continuous from southern Colombia
to central Mexico. Negative painting with
wax has a wider and perhaps earlier distribution,
reaching Ecuador and Peru in association with tripod
pottery which is otherwise rare in the Andean
region. Various motives of design link the two continents,
especially on the Toltec-Chorotegan level.
Between 1000 and 1200 A. D. civilization seems to
have been generally stabilized, but this halcyon age
was followed by disorganization and far-reaching
migrations. The pre-Spanish horizons of southern
Peru are tentatively arranged as follows by A. L.
Kroeber, the apparently earlier material of Ancon
being omitted for lack of the cross-ties.</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="r">III. </td><td class="l">Inca</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">IIc. </td><td class="l">Late Ica</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">IIb. </td><td class="l">Middle Ica</td></tr>

<tr><td class="r">Ib. </td><td class="l">Late Nasca</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">Ia. </td><td class="l">Early Nasca</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The early Nasca civilization was far from primitive
being characterized by pyramids, fine textiles,
and some metal. Mayan strains have been recognized
in Chavin and Recuay in Peru and various
sites in Ecuador.</p>
<p>The dynamic forces in the history of man in the
New World have a tremendous bearing upon the
present and future state of the world. The debt
which we owe to the ancient civilizations of Mexico
and Central America becomes apparent when we
list the more important agricultural plants, fibers,
gums, dyes, etc., which were taken over by Europeans
from the American Indians.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
